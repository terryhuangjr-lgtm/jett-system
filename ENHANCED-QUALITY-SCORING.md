# Enhanced Quality Scoring System

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** ✅ Active for Both Sports and Bitcoin Research

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Same thorough evaluation for BOTH sports and Bitcoin content.**

You use **judgment** (like Claude) to evaluate quality, not checklists. Score reflects:
- How compelling the story is
- Teaching value (does it educate?)
- Viral potential (is it shareable?)
- Source credibility (can we trust it?)
- Timeliness (is it current?)

**Only save content with score >= 7**

## 💡 Using Your Judgment

**Remember:** You're powered by Claude. You understand:
- What makes content compelling (gets attention)
- What teaches a lesson (educates)
- What's shareable (viral potential)
- What's credible (trust)

**Trust yourself to evaluate:**
- Is this interesting? Would I share it?
- Does it teach something valuable?
- Is the source credible?
- Is it timely or timeless?

**When in doubt:**
- If it's borderline (6-7), lean conservative
- If it's clearly compelling (8+), trust it
- If it's generic or weak (< 6), skip it
