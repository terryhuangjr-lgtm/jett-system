# NIL Deal Management Services: Comprehensive Business Strategy
## Multi-University Expansion Plan

**Prepared for:** Terry Huang  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Market:** College Athletic NIL Management Services

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Business Concept
Launch a comprehensive NIL deal management service that provides end-to-end representation, compliance, and brand-building services for college athletes across multiple universities. Unlike existing platforms that focus on technology or marketplaces, this service combines personal representation (like traditional sports agents) with institutional partnerships (like collectives) to create a hybrid model that serves both athletes and universities.

### Target Market
- **Primary:** NCAA Division I athletes at Power 4 conference schools (SEC, Big Ten, ACC, Big 12)
- **Secondary:** High-performing athletes at mid-major programs with strong athletic traditions
- **Tertiary:** High school athletes in states permitting NIL (40+ states currently)
- **Total addressable market:** $1.67B-$2.3B annually (2024-25), growing to $2.5B+ by 2026

### Value Proposition

**For Athletes:**
- **5.3x earnings multiplier** (data shows represented athletes earn 5.3x more than non-represented peers)
- Full-service representation: deal sourcing, negotiation, compliance, tax/legal coordination
- Brand development and content strategy
- Transfer-ready portfolio (transfer athletes earn 1.7x more)

**For Universities:**
- Turnkey NIL compliance solution (meets 30-day/$600 reporting requirements)
- Reduces administrative burden on athletic departments
- Competitive recruiting advantage through proven NIL infrastructure
- Revenue share optimization (managing $20.5M annual allocation per school)

**For Brands:**
- Vetted, compliant athlete partnerships
- Streamlined contracting across multiple schools
- Performance tracking and ROI measurement

### Financial Highlights
- **Startup Investment:** $850K-$1.2M (18-month runway)
- **Revenue Model:** 15-20% commission on athlete deals + $50K-$150K annual university partnerships
- **Year 1 Target:** 5 universities, 150 athletes, $2.5M gross deal volume → $450K revenue
- **Year 3 Projection:** 15 universities, 600 athletes, $15M deal volume → $2.8M revenue, $600K+ EBITDA
- **Break-even:** Month 16-18

### Strategic Recommendation
**PURSUE WITH MODIFICATIONS.** The NIL market is at an inflection point—the 2025 revenue-sharing model creates massive complexity that existing platforms aren't fully equipped to handle. However, this is a **competitive, capital-intensive market** requiring:
1. Strong legal/compliance infrastructure (non-negotiable)
2. Differentiated positioning vs. incumbents
3. Athletic department relationships (sales cycle: 6-12 months)
4. Patience through regulatory volatility

**Success hinges on:** Building trust with 2-3 anchor universities quickly, proving ROI, and scaling through network effects before larger competitors (Opendorse, Learfield) lock down market share.

   - **Services:** Influencer marketing, brand partnerships, campaign management
   - **Model:** Traditional agency (likely 15-25% commission)

   - **Notable:** "Generated significant dollars" through creative brand marketing

7. **Young Money APAA Sports, NIL Management, Others**

   - No registration/licensing requirements → quality varies widely

**Tier 3: Collectives (School-Specific)**

   - Power 4 average budget: $13.9M
   - Models: 501(c)(3) charities, LLCs, in-house programs

**Competitive Gaps (Our Opportunity)**

| What's Missing | Current Market | Our Solution |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Full-service athlete representation** | Platforms connect athletes to deals but don't negotiate/manage | Personal agent relationships + platform scale |
| **University compliance partnership** | Schools use platforms but still manage compliance internally | White-label compliance service integrated with athletic departments |
| **Transfer optimization** | Athletes lose deals/relationships when transferring | Portable athlete portfolio + multi-school network |
| **Fair market value defense** | "Pay-to-play" ban requires FMV justification | Transaction database + content performance metrics prove FMV |
| **Tax/legal coordination** | Athletes hire separately (expensive, inconsistent) | Vetted professional network + group rates |
| **Long-tail athlete monetization** | 68% of deals <$1,000; small athletes underserved | Micro-deal automation + group sponsorships |

### Regulatory Landscape

**Federal Level**
- **No federal NIL law** (as of Feb 2026)
- **House Settlement (June 2025):** $2.8B damages + revenue sharing framework
- **College Sports Commission (CSC):** New oversight body created by settlement
- **IRS Enforcement:** NIL designated as "top enforcement priority" for 2025

**NCAA Rules**
- **Disclosure Requirement:** Deals >$600 must be reported within 30 days (effective Aug 2024)
- **Professional Services Allowed:** Athletes can hire agents/advisors
- **No Pay-to-Play:** Deals must have "fair market value" basis (enforced July 2025)
- **School/Conference Autonomy:** Can set additional requirements

**State Laws (20+ States with Disclosure Mandates)**
- **Examples:**
  - Oregon: 7 days advance notice required
  - California: Athlete must disclose to school
  - Florida: No deals with conflicting sponsors
  - Texas: School must approve deals
- **Variation:** Product restrictions (alcohol, gambling, cannabis differ by state)
- **High School:** 40+ states allow HS NIL; 5 states still prohibit college NIL

**Compliance Pain Points**
1. **Multi-state athletes:** Player from California, school in Texas, brand in New York (3 jurisdictions)
2. **Transfer portal:** Changing schools = new state laws + new reporting requirements
3. **Real-time tracking:** 30-day disclosure window requires immediate systems
4. **Tax complexity:** 1099 income, state nexus issues, quarterly estimated taxes
5. **FMV documentation:** Proving "fair market value" post-July 2025 rule

**Regulatory Risk Assessment**
- **High:** Federal legislation could preempt state laws (would simplify compliance)
- **Medium:** Revenue sharing caps could change (currently $20.5M, grows 4% annually)
- **Medium:** IRS reclassification (employee vs. independent contractor)
- **Low:** Return to pre-2021 amateur model (political/legal momentum against)

### Market Dynamics & Forces

**Tailwinds**
1. **Revenue sharing complexity:** Schools need help managing $20.5M budgets
2. **Represented athlete earnings gap:** 5.3x multiplier drives demand for representation
3. **Transfer portal growth:** Athlete mobility increases need for portable NIL profiles
4. **Brand ROI:** 3x higher engagement than non-athlete influencers
5. **Women's sports momentum:** 85% YoY growth in women's basketball NIL

**Headwinds**
1. **Incumbent platforms:** Opendorse/INFLCR have 98% market penetration
2. **Economic pressure:** <15% of top 200 programs have $10M+ surplus
3. **Regulatory uncertainty:** Rules changing constantly
4. **Market concentration:** 50% of value in Power 4 (hard to access)
5. **Trust deficit:** Athlete exploitation concerns; agents have mixed reputation

- **Athlete analytics:** Hootsuite, Sprout Social, or Opendorse (if white-label partnership)
- **Cost:** $200-$500/month per tool
- **Use case:** Track athlete social media performance for FMV documentation

**5. Legal Document Management**
- **Contract templates:** Athlete representation agreements, brand partnership contracts, university MSAs
- **Tools:** DocuSign ($50/month), Ironclad (contract lifecycle)
- **Legal review:** External counsel ($10K-$20K for template library creation)

#### **Initial Technology Budget**
- **Year 1:** $30K-$50K (hybrid approach)
- **Year 2:** $80K-$120K (custom platform build)
- **Year 3:** $40K-$60K (maintenance + tools)

### Office & Operations

**Physical Office:**
- **Year 1:** Remote-first (team spread across target markets)
- **Year 2:** Shared office space near 2-3 anchor universities ($2K-$4K/month)
- **Year 3:** Small headquarters (3-5 person office) + remote team

**Insurance:**
- **General Liability:** $2K-$4K/year
- **E&O Insurance:** $5K-$10K/year (critical for compliance/agency work)
- **Workers Comp:** $3K-$6K/year (varies by state)

**Professional Services:**
- **Legal:** $30K-$50K/year (external counsel for complex deals, NCAA issues)
- **Accounting:** $15K-$25K/year (CPA, bookkeeper, tax prep)
- **HR/Benefits:** $10K-$20K/year (payroll, health insurance for team)

### Scalability Considerations

**Operational Leverage Points:**

1. **University partnerships scale athlete acquisition:**
   - One $100K university deal → access to 400 athletes
   - No individual athlete marketing costs
   - Athlete acquisition cost ≈ $250 per athlete (vs. $1K+ for consumer apps)

2. **Technology scales compliance:**
   - Compliance platform handles 50 or 5,000 athletes with minimal marginal cost
   - Automated deal review reduces need for compliance FTEs

3. **Brand partnerships drive revenue:**
   - One national brand deal (e.g., Nike campaign across 5 schools, 20 athletes, $500K total) generates $75K-$100K revenue
   - Higher margin than individual athlete deals

4. **Content/data as products:**
   - FMV database becomes standalone product (sell to schools/collectives)
   - Athlete performance analytics (benchmarking reports for $5K-$10K)

**Bottlenecks to Manage:**

1. **Athlete relationships don't scale infinitely:**
   - Elite athletes need dedicated reps (1 rep per 25-30 athletes max)
   - Solution: Tiered service model (automated for long-tail, high-touch for top earners)

2. **University sales cycles are long:**
   - 6-12 months per school
   - Solution: Build pipeline of 20+ schools to ensure 5 annual closes

3. **Regulatory complexity increases with scale:**
   - Each new state = new compliance requirements
   - Solution: Compliance platform + regional specialists

**Target Unit Economics (Year 3):**
- **Per University:** $100K-$150K annual revenue, $30K servicing cost = $70K-$120K gross margin (70-80%)
- **Per Athlete (Top tier):** $200K average NIL earnings × 15% commission = $30K revenue, $5K servicing cost = $25K gross margin (83%)
- **Per Athlete (Long tail):** $10K average NIL × 18% commission = $1.8K revenue, $200 servicing cost = $1.6K gross margin (89%)

   - **Pros:** No dilution, aligned incentives
   - **Cons:** Limited capital, debt service pressure

**Recommendation:** **$1M Seed Round** (mix of angel + small sports-focused VC). Rationale: Credibility with universities requires institutional backing; 18-month runway to prove model; access to VC network for university intros.

- **Months to break even:** 16-18 months (assuming 2 universities by Month 12, 4 by Month 15, 6 by Month 18)

**Downside Scenario (50% of Base Case):**
- **Universities (Y3):** 8 instead of 15
- **Revenue:** $2.6M instead of $5.2M
- **EBITDA:** $600K instead of $3.1M (still profitable, but requires cost discipline)

---

### Exit Opportunities (Long-Term)

**Potential Acquirers (5-7 Year Horizon):**

1. **Opendorse / INFLCR (Teamworks):** Consolidate market share
2. **Learfield / IMG:** Expand NIL service offerings
3. **Traditional Sports Agencies:** WME, CAA, Wasserman (entering college space)
4. **Financial Services:** PayPal, Stripe, Block (athlete payment infrastructure)
5. **HR Tech / Payroll:** ADP, Paychex (revenue sharing = payroll for athletes)

**Valuation Benchmarks (Based on Comparable SaaS / Marketplace Exits):**
- **SaaS Revenue Multiple:** 5-8x ARR (recurring university contracts)
- **Marketplace Multiple:** 1-2x GMV (athlete deal volume)
- **Year 3 Valuation (Blended):**
  - $4M ARR (university + data products) × 6 = $24M
  - $18M GMV × 1.5 = $27M
  - **Target Exit Valuation:** $30M-$50M (depending on growth trajectory, market position)

---

## 8. RISK ANALYSIS

### Regulatory Risks

**Risk 1: Federal Legislation Preempts Business Model**
- **Description:** Congress passes federal NIL law that standardizes rules, eliminates state-by-state variation
- **Probability:** Medium (40% in next 3 years)
- **Impact:** High (reduces compliance complexity = our core value prop weakens)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Pivot to "federal compliance + athlete representation" (less complexity, more focus on deal sourcing/negotiation)
  - Diversify revenue: Grow brand partnerships, data products (less dependent on compliance fees)
  - Advocacy: Participate in lobbying efforts to shape legislation favorably (e.g., ensure athlete representation still allowed)

**Risk 2: Revenue Sharing Caps Change Dramatically**
- **Description:** NCAA/courts change $20.5M cap (increase to $50M or decrease to $10M)
- **Probability:** Medium (30% in next 3 years)
- **Impact:** Medium (changes university budget priorities; higher cap = more NIL competition from schools)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor House Settlement implementation closely
  - Offer "revenue share consulting" as separate service (we help regardless of cap size)
  - Focus on differentiation: We optimize BOTH revenue share + third-party NIL (schools can only do revenue share)

**Risk 3: IRS Reclassifies Athletes as Employees**
- **Description:** IRS rules NIL income = W-2 wages (tax withholding, workers comp, benefits required)
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (20% in next 3 years)
- **Impact:** High (increases complexity but also increases our value as compliance experts)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Opportunity in disguise:** More complexity = more demand for expert compliance services
  - Partner with payroll providers (ADP, Gusto) to offer payroll-as-a-service
  - Tax practice becomes even more critical (hire in-house CPAs)

**Risk 4: State-by-State Fragmentation Worsens**
- **Description:** More states pass conflicting NIL laws (e.g., some ban certain deal types)
- **Probability:** Medium (35% in next 3 years)
- **Impact:** Low-Medium (increases our value but also operational complexity)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Opportunity:** More chaos = more demand for compliance expertise (competitive advantage)
  - Hire regional compliance specialists (1 per major region)
  - Compliance platform must scale to handle unlimited rule variations

---

### Competitive Risks

**Risk 5: Opendorse/INFLCR Adds Full-Service Representation**
- **Description:** Incumbents hire agents, offer end-to-end service (eliminating our differentiation)
- **Probability:** Medium-High (50% in next 2 years)
- **Impact:** High (directly competes with our model)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Speed to market:** Build strong university relationships + athlete loyalty before they can pivot
  - **Quality differentiation:** Agents require personal relationships; platforms struggle with high-touch service (cultural mismatch)
  - **Exclusive contracts:** Lock universities into 3-year deals (switching costs high)
  - **Niche down:** Focus on underserved segments (women's sports, Olympic sports, mid-majors) where incumbents focus less

**Risk 6: Universities Build In-House Teams**
- **Description:** Large programs hire 3-5 FTEs to manage NIL internally (vs. outsourcing to us)
- **Probability:** Medium (40% for top 25 programs)
- **Impact:** Medium (limits TAM to mid-tier schools)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Cost argument:** Hiring 3 FTEs = $300K+ annually; our service = $130K (cheaper + better expertise)
  - **Focus on mid-majors:** 90% of schools can't afford in-house teams (larger addressable market)
  - **White-label technology:** Even in-house teams need platforms; sell our compliance tech separately

**Risk 7: Traditional Sports Agencies Enter College Market**
- **Description:** CAA, WME, Wasserman launch college athlete divisions (brand + capital advantages)
- **Probability:** High (60% in next 2 years; already happening)
- **Impact:** High (compete for top athletes)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **University partnerships = moat:** Traditional agencies don't have university relationships; athletes prefer "school-endorsed" partners
  - **Long-tail focus:** Big agencies chase top 100 athletes; we serve all 2,000 (including long-tail)
  - **Compliance expertise:** Traditional agencies strong on deals, weak on college-specific compliance (our strength)

---

### Operational Risks

**Risk 8: Key Personnel Departure (General Counsel)**
- **Description:** Head of Compliance leaves; compliance expertise lost
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (25% in first 2 years)
- **Impact:** High (credibility + operational capability damaged)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Retention:** Competitive comp + equity (1-2% vesting over 4 years)
  - **Documentation:** Codify compliance processes (SOPs, playbooks) so knowledge isn't siloed
  - **Backup:** Retain external counsel (insurance policy)
  - **Succession plan:** Cross-train Director of Operations on compliance basics

**Risk 9: Compliance Failure / NCAA Violation**
- **Description:** We advise athlete on deal; turns out non-compliant; athlete/school penalized
- **Probability:** Low (10% in first 3 years, but HIGH IMPACT)
- **Impact:** Catastrophic (lose all credibility, lawsuits, business failure)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Insurance:** E&O insurance ($5M-$10M coverage)
  - **Conservative advice:** When in doubt, say no (protect reputation over short-term revenue)
  - **Legal review:** All complex deals reviewed by external counsel before approval
  - **Indemnification clauses:** Contracts with athletes/universities clarify liability (we advise; ultimate decision is theirs)
  - **Compliance audits:** Quarterly internal audits + annual third-party audit

**Risk 10: Technology/Platform Failure**
- **Description:** Compliance platform crashes during peak reporting period (e.g., end of month when 30-day disclosures due)
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (20% in first 2 years; common for startups)
- **Impact:** Medium (athlete deals delayed, university frustration, reputation damage)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Redundancy:** Cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud) with 99.9% uptime SLA
  - **Manual backup:** Paper/email backup process (low-tech but works)
  - **Dev partner:** Contract with experienced dev firm (not solo freelancer) for reliability
  - **Monitoring:** 24/7 uptime monitoring + on-call dev support

---

### Market Risks

**Risk 11: NIL Market Contracts (Economic Downturn)**
- **Description:** Recession → brands cut marketing budgets → fewer NIL deals → lower athlete earnings → our revenue drops
- **Probability:** Medium (30% in next 3 years; cyclical economy)
- **Impact:** Medium (revenue decline but universities still need compliance)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Diversified revenue:** University fees (recurring, stable) + athlete commissions (variable)
  - **Counter-cyclical value:** Economic uncertainty → more compliance scrutiny → universities invest in expert help
  - **Cost controls:** Variable cost structure (commissions scale with revenue; no fixed athlete salaries)

**Risk 12: Athlete Unionization / Employment Status Change**
- **Description:** Athletes unionize, negotiate collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that restricts third-party representation
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (25% in next 5 years)
- **Impact:** High (could eliminate third-party agents, force in-house only)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Monitor:** Track union movements (College Football Players Association, other efforts)
  - **Pivot:** If CBA restricts agents, pivot to "university services only" (schools still need compliance/tech)
  - **Advocacy:** Work with player associations to shape favorable terms (show we're athlete-friendly)

**Risk 13: High-Profile Scandal / Athlete Exploitation**
- **Description:** Industry-wide scandal (e.g., agency defrauds athletes) damages trust in all NIL service providers
- **Probability:** Medium (35% in next 3 years; unregulated market = bad actors)
- **Impact:** Medium (reputational damage to industry; regulatory crackdown)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Transparency:** Publish fee structures publicly (no hidden fees)
  - **Athlete-first branding:** Position as "athlete advocates" vs. "profit-driven agencies"
  - **Compliance leadership:** Advocate for industry standards, licensing requirements (raises barrier to entry, protects reputation)
  - **Insurance + escrow:** Athlete funds held in escrow (not commingled) to prevent misappropriation

---

### Risk Summary Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Priority |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Federal legislation | Medium | High | **HIGH** (diversify revenue) |
| Opendorse adds representation | High | High | **CRITICAL** (speed to market) |
| Universities build in-house | Medium | Medium | **MEDIUM** (focus mid-majors) |
| Compliance failure | Low | Catastrophic | **CRITICAL** (insurance + processes) |
| Traditional agencies enter | High | High | **HIGH** (university partnerships moat) |
| Key personnel departure | Medium | High | **MEDIUM** (retention + documentation) |
| IRS reclassification | Low | High | **LOW** (monitor + pivot plan) |
| NIL market contracts | Medium | Medium | **MEDIUM** (cost controls) |
| Technology failure | Medium | Medium | **MEDIUM** (redundancy + monitoring) |
| Athlete unionization | Low | High | **LOW** (monitor + advocacy) |

**Top 3 Risks to Address Immediately:**
1. **Compliance failure** → E&O insurance, conservative advice, legal review processes
2. **Opendorse competitive response** → Speed to market, lock in 5 universities ASAP (switching costs)
3. **Federal legislation** → Diversify revenue streams (not 100% dependent on compliance complexity)

---

## 9. RECOMMENDATION: SHOULD TERRY PURSUE THIS?

### Overall Assessment: **CONDITIONAL YES**

This is a **high-potential, high-risk opportunity** in a market at a critical inflection point. The NIL industry is transitioning from chaos to structure, creating a 12-24 month window where a well-executed new entrant can capture meaningful market share before consolidation occurs.

---

### Reasons to Pursue

#### **1. Large, Growing Market with Strong Tailwinds**
- $2.3B-$2.5B market in 2025, growing 9-20% annually
- Revenue sharing (starting 2025) adds complexity that existing platforms aren't fully equipped to handle
- Represented athletes earn **5.3x more** than unrepresented peers (massive ROI story)
- Women's sports explosion (85% YoY growth) creates underserved segment

#### **2. Clear Value Proposition & Differentiation**
- **For athletes:** Personal representation + platform scale (incumbents only do platform)
- **For universities:** Turnkey compliance + revenue share optimization (reduces $300K in-house hiring costs)
- **For brands:** Multi-school campaigns + compliance expertise (nobody else offers this)

#### **3. Strong Unit Economics (Once Scaled)**
- **University LTV:CAC = 6:1** (SaaS-like economics)
- **Year 3 EBITDA Margin = 60%** (highly profitable at scale)
- **Athlete acquisition via university partnerships** (near-zero CAC for long-tail athletes)

#### **4. Defensible Competitive Moats**
- **University partnerships:** Once locked in (3-year contracts), high switching costs
- **Transaction data:** Builds FMV database (critical for post-July 2025 compliance) → data moat like Opendorse
- **Multi-school network:** Transfer athletes need portable portfolios (incumbents are school-specific)
- **Compliance expertise:** Legal/tax knowledge is hard to replicate (not just technology)

#### **5. Multiple Exit Paths**
- Acquisition by Opendorse/INFLCR (consolidate market share)
- Acquisition by traditional agencies (CAA, WME entering college market)
- Acquisition by financial services (athlete payment infrastructure)
- Standalone profitability (Year 3 EBITDA = $3M+ supports sustainable business)

---

### Reasons to Pause / Concerns

#### **1. Competitive Market with Entrenched Incumbents**
- **Opendorse has 98% university penetration** (tough to displace)
- **50% probability** Opendorse adds full-service representation (eliminates our differentiation)
- Traditional sports agencies (CAA, WME) entering with brand + capital advantages

**Counterpoint:** Incumbents have platform business models (low-touch, self-serve); pivoting to high-touch representation is culturally difficult. Our window is 12-24 months before they adapt.

#### **2. Long, Complex Sales Cycles**
- **6-12 month university sales cycles** (enterprise SaaS-like)
- Requires warm intros, industry relationships, conference credibility
- Risk: Burn through capital before closing enough deals

**Counterpoint:** Pilot programs (90-day, $10K) shorten time-to-revenue. Advisory board with former ADs provides credibility + intros. Year 1 target (2 universities) is achievable.

#### **3. Regulatory Uncertainty**
- **40% probability of federal NIL law** (could simplify market, reduce compliance value)
- **20% probability of IRS reclassification** (athletes as employees)
- **Compliance failure risk** (one mistake = catastrophic reputational damage)

**Counterpoint:** Federal law would reduce complexity but increase uniformity (still need compliance + representation). IRS change increases complexity (opportunity). E&O insurance + conservative advice mitigates compliance risk.

#### **4. Capital Intensive (Needs $1M+ to Prove Model)**
- **18-month runway required** to close 5 universities + prove profitability
- Requires fundraising (dilution) or significant personal capital

**Counterpoint:** Strong ROI once scaled (60% EBITDA margin). Sports tech VCs actively investing (Elysian Park, Everblue). $1M seed round is achievable with right team + traction.

#### **5. Execution Risk: Compliance Expertise Required**
- **MUST hire experienced General Counsel / Compliance Head** (non-negotiable)
- If Terry lacks sports law network, finding this person is hard + expensive ($150K-$180K)

**Counterpoint:** Advisory board can help recruit. Compliance role is "make-or-break" hire; worth paying top dollar. External counsel can supplement (but not replace) in-house expertise.

---

### Key Success Factors (Must-Haves)

| Factor | Why It Matters | How to Achieve It |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1. Compliance Credibility** | Without it, universities won't trust us; one mistake = business failure | Hire experienced General Counsel (former NCAA, Big Law sports practice); retain external counsel; E&O insurance; conservative advice |
| **2. First 2 Universities (Year 1)** | Proof of concept; reference customers; revenue to extend runway | Leverage advisory board for warm intros; target mid-tier schools (less competitive); offer 90-day pilots (low-risk trial); attend NACDA conference |
| **3. Represented Athlete "5.3x Premium" Proof** | Core value prop; must deliver ROI or athletes churn | Proactive deal sourcing (not just platform); dedicated reps for top earners; content coaching + brand development; track + publish results |
| **4. Speed to Market (Before Opendorse Pivots)** | 12-24 month window before incumbents adapt | Launch in 6 months (not 12); MVP compliance platform (not perfect); prioritize university #1 over perfecting product |
| **5. Capital Efficiency** | $1M must last 18 months (can't afford second fundraise quickly) | Remote-first team (reduce overhead); hybrid technology approach (off-shelf tools first); focus on high-margin revenue (athlete commissions, not just university fees) |

---

### Decision Framework: When to Pursue vs. Pass

**PURSUE IF:**
- ✅ Terry can commit **full-time for 18+ months** (part-time won't work; sales cycles too long)
- ✅ Can raise **$750K-$1M seed capital** within 3 months (either personal funds, angels, or seed VC)
- ✅ Can recruit **General Counsel with NCAA/college sports compliance background** (non-negotiable; without this, don't start)
- ✅ Has **warm introductions to 3-5 athletic directors** (via advisory board, personal network, or investors)
- ✅ Willing to accept **40-60% dilution over 3 years** (if VC-funded path)
- ✅ Comfortable with **regulatory/compliance risk** (one mistake = existential threat)

**PASS IF:**
- ❌ Cannot commit full-time (nights/weekends won't close university deals)
- ❌ Cannot raise $750K+ (insufficient runway = failure)
- ❌ Cannot find experienced compliance hire (reputational risk too high)
- ❌ No path to first 2 university customers (sales will take too long)
- ❌ Risk-averse (regulatory volatility, competitive threats too stressful)

---

### Alternative / Hybrid Approaches

If full pursuit feels too risky, consider these modified approaches:

#### **Option A: "Services-First" Model (Lower Capital Needs)**
- Skip technology build initially; pure consulting/representation firm
- Offer compliance consulting to 5-10 universities ($50K each = $250K-$500K revenue)
- Represent 20-30 top athletes (high-touch, manual)
- Use Opendorse/INFLCR platforms for deal flow (don't build competing tech)
- **Capital needs:** $300K-$500K (mostly team salaries)
- **Pros:** Faster to revenue, less technology risk, proves demand
- **Cons:** Harder to scale, less defensible (no tech moat), lower valuation

#### **Option B: "Niche Specialist" Model (Smaller TAM, Less Competition)**
- Focus exclusively on **women's sports NIL** (85% YoY growth, underserved)
- OR focus on **high school NIL** (40+ states, different competitors)
- OR focus on **Olympic sports** (ignored by big agencies)
- **Capital needs:** $500K-$750K (smaller team, narrower scope)
- **Pros:** Less competitive, clear differentiation, strong mission (empowering female athletes)
- **Cons:** Smaller market, limits long-term scale

#### **Option C: "Technology Licensing" Model (Lower Risk, Lower Upside)**
- Build compliance platform only (not full-service representation)
- License to universities, collectives, agencies as white-label SaaS
- Partner with existing agencies for representation (vs. competing)
- **Capital needs:** $400K-$600K (technology build + SaaS sales)
- **Pros:** Pure SaaS economics, less operational complexity, no compliance liability
- **Cons:** Crowded (Opendorse, INFLCR already dominate), lower revenue potential

---

### Terry's Next Steps (If Pursuing)

#### **Immediate (Next 30 Days):**
1. **Validate interest:** Conduct 10 interviews with athletic directors, compliance officers, athletes
   - Questions: "What's your biggest NIL pain point?" "Would you pay $100K/year to outsource compliance?" "What would make you switch from Opendorse?"
2. **Recruit advisory board:** Target 2-3 advisors (former AD, compliance expert, athlete agent)
3. **Assess personal commitment:** Can you go full-time for 18 months? If not, consider Option A or C (lower time investment)
4. **Financial planning:** Can you personally invest $100K-$200K? If not, map out fundraising plan

#### **Months 2-3: Foundation**
5. **Form entity** (LLC or C-Corp if seeking VC)
6. **Hire General Counsel** (or secure retainer with sports law firm)
7. **Build financial model + pitch deck**
8. **Fundraise:** Pitch 20-30 angel investors / seed VCs (target $750K-$1M close by Month 3)

#### **Months 4-6: Go-to-Market**
9. **Attend NACDA Convention** (June) or similar conference (critical for warm intros)
10. **Pilot proposal:** Present to 3-5 target universities
11. **Hire Director of Operations / Athlete Services**
12. **Build MVP compliance platform** (hybrid approach: Airtable + custom forms)

#### **Months 7-12: Proof of Concept**
13. **Execute pilot at University #1**
14. **Convert pilot → full contract**
15. **Close University #2**
16. **Enroll 150-200 athletes**
17. **Prove unit economics** (cost to serve, revenue per university, athlete satisfaction)

---

### Final Recommendation

**YES, PURSUE—but with strategic modifications:**

1. **Start with "Services-First" approach (Option A) in Year 1:**
   - Lower capital needs ($500K vs. $1M)
   - Faster to revenue (consulting fees within 3-6 months)
   - Proves demand before building expensive technology
   - Use existing platforms (Opendorse) for deal flow initially

2. **Focus on niche in Year 1 to avoid head-on competition with Opendorse:**
   - Target **mid-major schools** (not Power 4) → less competitive
   - OR focus on **women's sports + Olympic sports** (underserved, high growth)
   - Build credibility, case studies, transaction data

3. **Build technology moat in Year 2 (once revenue proven):**
   - Use Year 1 profits + additional fundraising to build custom platform
   - FMV database becomes competitive advantage
   - Scale to Power 4 schools with proven model + technology

4. **Plan for exit or strategic partnership by Year 4-5:**
   - Target acquisition by Opendorse, Learfield, or traditional agency
   - Valuation: $30M-$50M (based on Year 3 projections)
   - Alternative: Remain standalone profitable business (60% EBITDA margins support this)

**Bottom line:** This is **not a sure thing**, but it's a **calculated bet with strong upside**. The NIL market is at an inflection point (revenue sharing, regulatory changes), creating opportunity for disruption. Success requires:
- **Exceptional execution** (compliance perfection, fast sales cycles)
- **Right team** (General Counsel is make-or-break hire)
- **12-24 month speed advantage** (before Opendorse adapts)

If Terry can commit full-time, raise $500K-$750K, and recruit a strong compliance lead, this is **worth pursuing**. If any of those are uncertain, consider the lower-risk alternatives (Option A, B, or C) or **pass** and revisit in 1-2 years after market settles.

### Expected Outcomes by Scenario

| Scenario | Probability | Year 3 Outcome | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Strong Success** | 25% | 15 universities, $5M revenue, $3M EBITDA, acquisition offer $40M-$60M | Fast execution, Opendorse slow to respond, strong compliance reputation |
| **Moderate Success** | 40% | 8-10 universities, $2.5M revenue, $600K EBITDA, sustainable standalone business | Slower growth, regional niche, profitable but not unicorn |
| **Struggle / Pivot** | 25% | 3-5 universities, $1M revenue, break-even, pivot to consulting-only model | Longer sales cycles, capital constraints, technology delayed |
| **Failure** | 10% | Shut down, capital loss, lessons learned | Compliance failure, key hire leaves, federal legislation eliminates market, Opendorse crushes us |

**Expected Value Calculation (5-year horizon):**
- Strong Success: 25% × $10M+ (Terry's stake at exit)
- Moderate Success: 40% × $2M (Terry's stake in profitable co)
- Struggle: 25% × $0 (time + capital investment lost)
- Failure: 10% × -$500K (capital loss)

**Expected Value:** ~$3M (positive, but high variance)

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Staying in current role: $500K-$1M earnings over 5 years (low risk)
- Joining established company: $1M-$2M (medium risk)
- Starting this venture: $0-$10M+ (high risk, high reward)

**Conclusion:** Attractive for **high-risk-tolerance founders** with **sports industry background + fundraising ability**. Not suitable for first-time founders or those seeking guaranteed income.
