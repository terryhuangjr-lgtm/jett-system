# 21M Sports Content Workflow

## ⚠️ NO AUTOMATED GENERATION

**21M Sports content is NOT part of automated briefs or scheduled jobs.**

Terry will request content when needed. Do NOT proactively generate unless asked.

## When Terry Requests Content

**Process:**
1. Open `21M-SPORTS-CHECKLIST.md`
2. Complete all 5 steps
3. Use X (bird search) AND web_search
4. Provide 3-5 options with sources
5. Wait for Terry's feedback

## Research Sources (in order)

**1. X/Twitter (for trends + angles)**
```bash
bird search "NBA contract" --count 20
bird search "MLB signing" --count 20
bird search "[player name]" --count 10
```

**2. Web Search (for verification)**
```bash
web_search("Kyle Tucker contract Spotrac")
web_search("BTC price December 2023")
web_search("[player] bankruptcy story verified")
```

**3. Contract Databases**
- Spotrac.com
- Basketball-Reference.com
- Pro-Football-Reference.com

**4. BTC Price Data**
- CoinGecko (historical)
- Yahoo Finance
- Blockchain explorers

## Content Types

**Time-Relevant (when available):**
- Recent signings (last 7 days)
- Breaking news
- Trending players

**Historical (always available):**
- Contract comparisons across eras
- Fiat debasement examples (2000s vs 2020s)
- Athlete wealth stories (verified bankruptcies)

**Both work!** Don't force timeliness if historical data is cleaner/better.

## Quality Check

Before sending to Terry:
- ✅ Used X + web search
- ✅ Verified all facts
- ✅ Included sources
- ✅ Math is correct
- ✅ Zero fabrications

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Auto-generate in morning briefs
- ❌ Send content proactively without request
- ❌ Skip research steps
- ❌ Generate without sources
- ❌ Force timeliness over accuracy

---

**Bottom line:** Terry asks → You research → You verify → You deliver with sources.
