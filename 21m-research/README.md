# 21M Sports Research Cache

## Purpose
Local database of sports contracts, player salaries, and historical data for 21M Sports content creation.

## What Gets Saved Here
- Player contracts (current and historical)
- Salary comparisons across eras
- BTC prices at time of major deals
- Fiat debasement examples
- Bankruptcy stories
- Sound money athlete examples

## How It Works
- Grok searches X/social for contract news
- I save verified data locally
- Builds over time = faster content creation
- Claude Code's content generator taps into this
- No repeated research for same info

## Structure
```
