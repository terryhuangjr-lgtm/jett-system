## Batting Cage Business Details

**Target Location (Long Island):**
- **Primary area:** Nassau County - North Shore
- **Specific towns:** New Hyde Park, Roslyn, Manhasset, Great Neck, Lynbrook, Valley Stream
- **Also considering:** Western Nassau

**Funding:**
- **Plan:** Self-funded (betting on himself)
- **Budget:** $100-150K initially
- **Backup:** May seek investors depending on size/opportunity
- **Potential partners:** Brothers or ex-boss Pat (trusted, experienced business owner)

**Timeline:**
- **Target:** Q2 2026 to seriously start searching for property
- **Phase 1:** Find property, build website, buy equipment
- **Goal:** Get operational ASAP

**Current Blockers:**
- **Big question:** Is this the right move?
- **Family timing:** Waiting for right moment
- **Business model:** What kind of batting cage? Boutique or large? What size?

**Goal:**
- Primary: Cash flow
- Secondary: Possibly sell or hold long-term (TBD)
- Philosophy: Easy to run and scale

## Tool Routing Strategy

**Model Selection Rules (Phase 1):**

- **Grok-3** → X/Twitter searches, social media research, real-time trending topics, sports news
- **21M Sports Generator** → Daily content creation (built by Claude Code, production ready)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default)** → Everything else (analysis, planning, execution, writing)

**21M Sports Workflow:**
1. Use built-in content generator for daily posts (fast, fact-checked)
2. Use Grok-3 for trending topics and viral content research
3. Hybrid approach = best of both worlds

**Implementation:** Jett automatically uses the right tool for each task.

**Why:** Generator is faster + fact-checked. Grok finds what's trending. Claude handles everything else.

**Future (Phase 2):** Add Gemini for web searches if costs justify it.

- **Slack (PRIMARY):** Main communication channel
  - **Morning briefs:** Slack DM
  - **21M Sports content:** #21msports channel

### Task Execution Style (1-on-1 Channels)
**Rule: Acknowledge → Work → Done/Blocked**
1. Quick acknowledgment when task received
2. Work silently
3. Only message when:
   - Complete (with results)
   - Blocked (need input)
   - Error/issue

**No:** Play-by-play updates, mini progress reports, unnecessary check-ins

### Decision-Making Style
- **Wants:** Full breakdown with details (not quick takes)
- **Wants:** Recommendations ("tell me what you'd do"), not just options
- **Style:** Deep analysis, values thorough research
- **Risk:** Moderate to aggressive (lean aggressive)
- **Preference:** Best recommendation upfront, then options if needed

## Core Values & Philosophy

**Values-Driven:**
- Atheist, slightly spiritual
- Morally sound, always tries to do the right thing
- Father (died 2022) was his biggest influence
  - First-gen immigrant (China/Taiwan), self-built success
  - Always did right, treated people with respect
  - Nice but stern, prioritized family and happiness
- Michael Jordan was childhood idol → father became that figure as adult

**Life Priorities (in order):**
1. **Time** - Greatest asset, wants free time with family
2. **Family** - Wife + 2 daughters, give them best upbringing
3. **Humble living** - Live within means, don't need fancy things
4. **Travel** - See the world with family
5. Everything else is icing on top

**Not motivated by:**
- Getting rich
- Impressing people
- Status symbols
- Hustle culture BS

## Sports Card Business (Active Side Hustle)

**Current Operation:**
- Terry + his brother buy/sell/trade sports cards
- Active hobby and side hustle (generates revenue)
- Plans to scale later in 2026
- Domain expertise in cards, grading, market values

**Opportunity:**
- Automation can eliminate gruntwork
- Find deals faster than competitors
- Scale operation with same time investment
- Professional tools for serious business

**Tools being built:**
- eBay API automation (find undervalued cards)
- Automated comp checking (calculate profit potential)
- Inventory tracking (monitor portfolio value)
- Deal alerts (ending soon, hot opportunities)

**Why this matters:**
This isn't exploration - it's infrastructure for an ACTIVE revenue-generating business.
