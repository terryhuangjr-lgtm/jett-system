# Local Dashboards

## Purpose
Static HTML dashboards you can open in any browser - no server needed, no external dependencies.

## Available Dashboards
- **token-usage.html** - API usage tracking (from dashboard/ project)
- **project-status.html** - All active projects at a glance
- **21m-performance.html** - 21M Sports content performance
- **opportunities.html** - Side hustle opportunities found

## How It Works
- I generate/update HTML files automatically
- You open them in browser anytime (file:// URLs work)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS - no backend needed
- Updates happen via cron or when triggered

## Why Local?
- Zero hosting costs
- Always available (even offline)
- Fast (no network calls)
- Private (not exposed to internet)

Dashboards will appear here as I build them.
