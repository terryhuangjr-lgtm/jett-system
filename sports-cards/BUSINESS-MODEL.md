# Sports Card Business - Complete Model

## Business Overview

**Partners:** Terry + Brother  
**Current Stage:** Hobby level (growing capital, not paying out yet)  
**Scale Goal:** Active daily operation later in 2026

---

## Core Business Model

### **Buy → Grade → Sell Strategy**

**1. Acquire Raw Cards** ($10-500 range)
- Focus on cards with grading potential
- Need to identify what will grade PSA 9 or 10

**2. Submit to PSA for Grading**
- Current bottleneck: Many cards tied up in grading
- Scale plan: Submit every 2 weeks (constant pipeline)

**3. Value Boost from Grading**
- **PSA 10 (Gem Mint):** 3x+ value boost ✨
- **PSA 9:** 20-30% profit 
- **PSA 8 or lower:** Relist raw to recover money

**4. Sell Graded Cards**
- Target: Average 1x return (doubling money)
- Reality: Mix of big hits + small losses
- Strategy: Volume game, take all small wins

## Market Dynamics (Critical Understanding)

### **Values Are Constantly Changing:**
- Player performance (hot streak = prices spike)
- Trends (insert types go in/out of fashion)
- Influencers/big collectors (drive demand for specific cards)
- Season timing (load up before season if expecting callup/big year)
- Injuries (player hurt = hold until recovery)

### **Why Recent Comps Are Critical:**
- Market moves fast
- Yesterday's comp might not apply today
- Need real-time sold listings

### **Timing Is Everything:**
- Buy before hype builds
- Sell at peak performance
- Hold through injuries if long-term confident
- Know when to take profits

---

## Product Focus

### **Sports:**
- Football
- Baseball  
- Basketball

### **Era:**
- Late 80s to modern day
- Current rookies: Cooper Flagg, Derik Queen (2025-26)

### **Card Types (What They Buy):**
- **Rookies** (high potential, grade well)
- **On-card autographs** (premium)
- **Serial numbered** (/500 or less - lower = better)
- **Parallels** (Gold /10 = HOT 🔥)
- **Michael Jordan cards** (always valuable)
- **Ken Griffey Jr cards** (Terry's era)
- Many other star players

### **Hot Inserts (Current Trends):**
- Downtown
- Kabooms
- Prizm Manga inserts

---

## Price Ranges

**Normal Range:** $10 - $500  
**Big Purchase:** $500+

**Why this range:**
- Affordable volume play
- Grading ROI makes sense
- Risk manageable

---

## Grading Strategy

### **Focus: Raw Cards**
**Why:** Core business model (buy raw → grade → sell graded)

**Grading Knowledge Required:**
- Identify centering
- Check corners/edges
- Spot surface issues
- Know what will grade 9 or 10

**If card won't grade 9+:** Relist immediately to recover money

### **Buying Slabs (Secondary):**
**PSA 10s or BGS 9.5s only if:**
- Really like the player long-term
- See clear arbitrage opportunity

**Why less focus:**
- Already graded = already priced at premium
- Need to hold longer (waiting for performance appreciation)
- Less immediate profit potential

---

## Current Operations

### **Division of Labor:**

**Brother:**
- Does most buying/browsing
- Uses Buyee (Japanese eBay) heavily - finds tons of opportunities
- Uses Chinese auction sites
- "He's crazy" - finds deals everywhere

**Terry:**
- Some buying
- **Operations** (processing, organizing)
- **Shipping** (when batch returns from PSA or has time)

### **Current Workflow Issues:**
- Many cards tied up in PSA grading
- Workflow interrupted by grading turnaround
- Been slacking off lately (not actively hunting)

---

## Scale Plan (Later 2026)

### **If They Scale:**

**1. Increase Buying Frequency**
- Almost daily buys
- More active deal hunting

**2. PSA Pipeline Management**
- Submit every 2 weeks
- Always have cards in grading
- Always have cards coming back soon
- Smooth, constant workflow

**3. Expand Sourcing Channels**
- Hit local card stores
- Attend card shows
- Keep eBay/Buyee/Chinese sites active

**4. Professionalize Operations**
- Better inventory management
- Track what's in grading
- Monitor market trends actively
- Time purchases with seasons/callups

---

## Current Sourcing

### **Active Channels:**
1. **eBay** (main platform)
2. **Buyee** (Japanese eBay - brother's secret weapon)
3. **Chinese auction sites** (brother uses)

### **Not Yet Active (Scale Plan):**
- Local card stores
- Card shows

---

## Competition

**Everyone:**
- Card show dealers
- Local card stores
- General public collectors
- Other eBay flippers
- Professional graders/flippers

**What competitors miss:**
- Terry/brother have grading eye (know what grades well)
- Multi-platform sourcing (Buyee, Chinese sites)
- Market timing knowledge

---

## Profit Model

### **Target:**
- Average **1x return** (double the money) = amazing

### **Reality:**
- Mix of **bigger hits** (3x+ on PSA 10s)
- Mix of **small losses** (cards that don't grade well)

### **Strategy:**
- **Volume game** (lots of transactions)
- **Take all small wins** (20-30% is good)
- **Big hits cover losses** (PSA 10s pay for mistakes)

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Grading Knowledge** - Know what will grade 9 or 10
2. **Market Timing** - Buy before hype, sell at peak
3. **Trend Awareness** - Know what inserts are hot
4. **Player Knowledge** - Performance expectations, injury risk
5. **Multi-Platform** - Find deals where others aren't looking

---

## Current Challenges

2. **Not actively hunting** (been slacking off)
3. **Manual research** (finding comps, checking trends)
4. **Time-intensive** (browsing, evaluating, researching)

---

**Multi-Platform:**
