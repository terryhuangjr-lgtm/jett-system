# International Site Automation - Buyee & Chinese Auctions

## Can We Automate Buyee/Chinese Sites?

**SHORT ANSWER: YES! 🔥**

The stealth browser can scrape ANY website, including:
- Buyee (Japanese eBay)
- Chinese auction sites
- International marketplaces
- Literally anything your brother browses

## How It Works

### Stealth Browser Capabilities
- Navigate any website (including international)
- Bypass bot detection (Cloudflare, CAPTCHA, etc.)
- Handle different languages (Japanese, Chinese, etc.)
- Extract listings, prices, photos
- Monitor for new items
- Track price changes

### What We Can Automate

**Buyee Monitoring:**
1. Search for specific cards/players
2. Extract all listings with photos
3. Compare prices to US eBay
4. Flag arbitrage opportunities (Japan $50 → US $150)
5. Alert on new listings
6. Track sold prices (comps)

**Chinese Auction Sites:**
1. Same capabilities as Buyee
2. Handle different UI/language
3. Extract pricing in local currency
4. Convert to USD for comparison
5. Monitor auctions ending soon

**Cross-Platform Arbitrage:**
- Compare same card across:
  - eBay US
  - Buyee (Japan)
  - Chinese sites
- Auto-calculate profit after:
  - Shipping
  - Fees
  - Currency conversion
- Alert when arbitrage exists

## Work Intensity

**Initial Setup:** Medium (need to map each site's structure)
**Ongoing:** LOW (runs automatically)

**Setup process (one-time per site):**
1. Understand site structure (where listings are)
2. Map search functionality
3. Extract listing data (price, photos, seller, etc.)
4. Test extraction accuracy
5. Set up monitoring schedule

**Time estimate:** 
- Buyee: 2-3 hours to set up
- Chinese sites: 2-3 hours each
- Total: ~1 day of Claude Code work

**After setup:**
- Runs automatically (scheduled tasks)
- Daily/hourly scans
- Zero manual work

## Why This Is "Friggin' Huge"

**Your brother's edge:**
- Manually browses Buyee/Chinese sites
- Finds deals others miss
- Time-intensive

**With automation:**
- Scanner browses 24/7
- Monitors ALL listings (not just what he sees)
- Finds arbitrage automatically
- Never sleeps, never misses deals

**Scaling impact:**
- Brother can focus on buying (not browsing)
- Cover more categories/players
- Catch deals in different time zones
- **10x the opportunity flow**

## Technical Approach

**Option 1: Stealth Browser (More Work, More Flexible)**
- Scrape sites directly
- No API needed
- Works for ANY site
- Setup: Medium effort
- Maintenance: Low

**Option 2: API (If Available)**
- Check if Buyee/Chinese sites have APIs
- Faster, more reliable
- Setup: Low effort (if API exists)
- Cost: Depends on API pricing

**Recommendation:**
- Start with stealth browser (works for everything)
- Switch to APIs later if they exist and make sense

## Questions for Your Brother

**To optimize international automation:**

1. **Buyee specifics:**
   - What search terms does he use?
   - Categories to monitor?
   - Any sellers he watches?

2. **Chinese sites:**
   - Which sites exactly? (URLs?)
   - How does he search?
   - Payment/shipping logistics?

3. **Arbitrage criteria:**
   - Minimum profit margin to act?
   - Shipping costs from Japan/China?
   - Import fees/duties?
   - Currency risk tolerance?

4. **Volume:**
   - How many international purchases per month?
   - Worth the automation effort?

5. **Timing:**
   - Different time zones = auctions end odd hours
   - Want alerts for ending-soon auctions?

## Next Steps

**When ready to build:**
1. Get site URLs from brother
2. Hand to Claude Code with requirements
3. He builds scrapers for each site
4. Test and refine
5. Schedule as automated tasks
6. Daily digest delivered to Slack

**Timeline:**
- Setup: 1-2 days (Claude Code)
- Testing: 1-2 days
- Live: Week after eBay API is ready

**Cost:** $0 (runs locally on your machine)
