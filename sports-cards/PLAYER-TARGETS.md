# Player Targets & Market Strategy

## Investment Philosophy
**Like stocks:** When someone is hot, market is overpriced (hype premium)
**Edge:** Look for underappreciated markets

## Tier 1: Always Hot (Blue Chips)
- Michael Jordan
- Tom Brady
- Ken Griffey Jr
- Kobe Bryant

*Great markets, but priced in*

## Tier 2: Next Level
- Ichiro
- Albert Pujols
- Chipper Jones
- Barry Bonds
- Peyton Manning
- Patrick Mahomes
- Aaron Rodgers

*Strong markets, good liquidity*

## Tier 3: Undervalued (Target Rich) ⭐
**90s/2000s Superstars & HOFers:**
- Dwyane Wade
- Dirk Nowitzki
- Tim Duncan
- Allen Iverson

**Why undervalued:**
- Age of cards = harder to find mint condition
- Market hasn't caught up to their legacy
- Contrarian opportunity

**Challenge:** Condition scarcity (older cards)

## Rookies to Watch

### High Conviction
**Derik Queen (Basketball)**
- Low key, under the radar
- Star potential
- Could see value jump

**Cam Ward (Football - Titans)**
- Down year but very talented
- Buying the dip opportunity

### Hot But Overpriced
**Cooper Flagg (Basketball)**
- Legit talent, no doubt
- Prices through the roof (hype premium)
- Wait for dip or avoid

## Market Strategy

**Buy:**
- Underappreciated 90s/2000s HOFers
- Under-the-radar rookies with potential
- Post-injury dips (talented players)
- Off-season (before hype builds)

**Avoid:**
- Peak hype rookies (Cooper Flagg level)
- "Read" in title (damaged cards)
- Overheated markets

**Hold:**
- Injured players (wait for recovery/return)
- Talented rookies having down years (Cam Ward)

---

**Scanner should prioritize:**
1. Tier 3 undervalued players (Wade, Dirk, Duncan, AI)
2. Tier 2 when below comps
3. Derik Queen, Cam Ward rookies
4. Tier 1 only if significantly below market
