## What This Means

**We can automate:**

- Card Hobby searches (Chinese market)
- Cross-platform price comparisons
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- 24/7 monitoring

**How it works:**
- Stealth browser bypasses bot detection
- Scrapes listings, prices, photos
- Extracts data just like a human browsing
- Runs on Terry's always-on machine (free)

## Setup Requirements (When Ready)

**From Terry's brother:**
1. Specific search terms used on each site
2. Categories to monitor
3. Any preferred sellers
4. Shipping cost estimates (for profit calculations)

**Time to build:**
- Buyee scraper: 2-3 hours (Claude Code)
- Card Hobby scraper: 2-3 hours (Claude Code)
- Arbitrage comparison: 1-2 hours
- **Total:** ~1 day of Claude Code work

**Ongoing cost:** $0 (runs locally)

## NOT Building Now

Per Terry: "Slowing down" - not scaling card business yet

**This is just confirmation that it's possible when ready.**
