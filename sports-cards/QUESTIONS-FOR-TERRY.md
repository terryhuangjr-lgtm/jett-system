# Questions to Refine the Automation

## Grading Assessment

**Q1:** What specific visual cues tell you a raw card will grade PSA 9 or 10?

I'm assuming:
- Centering (most critical?)
- Sharp corners
- No surface scratches
- Clean edges

**Am I missing anything?** What's the priority order?

---

## Comp Strategy

**Q2:** When you research comps, how far back do you look?

- Last 7 days?
- Last 30 days?
- Last 3 months?

**And:** Do you ignore outliers (super high/low sales)?

---

## Hot Trends

**Q3:** Are Downtown, Kaboom, and Prizm Manga still the hottest inserts?

Or have trends shifted to something else recently?

**What should the automation watch for?**

---

## Risk Tolerance

**Q4:** Deal scoring (1-10 scale):

**🔥 Score 8-10:** Immediate Slack alert  
**⚡ Score 6-7:** Include in morning report  
**💰 Score 4-5:** Weekly digest

**Is this right?** Or do you want everything above a certain threshold?

---

## Brother Coordination

**Q5:** Should your brother get these alerts too?

- Same Slack channel as you?
- Separate channel for him?
- Email instead?
- Not needed (you coordinate manually)?

**How do you split the work?**

---

## Platform Priority

**Q6:** Focus on eBay first, or also try to integrate Buyee ASAP?

- eBay only (get it working first)
- Buyee too (brother's secret weapon)
- Chinese sites (brother uses these)

**What's the priority?**

---

## Inventory Tracking

**Q7:** Do you track what's currently in grading with PSA?

- Spreadsheet?
- Mental notes?
- Nothing formal?

**Would inventory tracking help?** (What's with PSA, what's back, estimated return dates, etc.)

---

## Timing Intelligence

**Q8:** Player performance / season timing - how do you track this now?

- Manual (you just know the sport)
- News alerts?
- Follow specific accounts?

**Could automation help?** (Alert when your players are called up, perform well, etc.)

---

## Deal Velocity

**Q9:** How many cards do you realistically want to buy per week?

- 5-10 cards/week?
- 10-20 cards/week?
- More if deals are good?

**This helps calibrate alert volume** (don't want to flood you).

---

## Profit Floor

**Q10:** What's the minimum profit that's worth your time?

For grading arbitrage specifically:
- $20 profit minimum?
- $50?
- Percentage-based (must be 50%+ return)?

**Where's the cutoff for "not worth it"?**

---

## Scale Timeline

**Q11:** When do you actually plan to scale up?

- Q2 2026 (April-June)?
- Q3 2026 (July-Sept)?
- Depends on other factors?

**This helps prioritize features** (inventory tracking, trend monitoring, etc.).

---

## Brother's Buyee Success

**Q12:** You said your brother kills it on Buyee - what's his secret?

- Specific search terms?
- Better prices in Japan?
- Different card availability?
- Less competition?

**Understanding his success helps me replicate it for eBay.**

---

## Biggest Time Sink

**Q13:** What takes the MOST time right now?

- Finding deals (browsing eBay)
- Researching comps
- Evaluating condition
- Shipping/operations
- Something else?

**What would save the most time if automated?**

---

## Current Bottleneck

**Q14:** You mentioned cards tied up in PSA grading messes up workflow - how?

- Don't know what's coming back when?
- Can't plan purchases around grading budget?
- Hard to list returns promptly?

**Would tracking help?** Or is it just inherent to the model?

---

## Success Metric

**Q15:** If automation works perfectly, what does success look like in 3 months?

- Find X more deals per week?
- Save X hours per week?
- Increase revenue by X%?
- Just make the workflow smoother?

**What's the goal?**

---

**No rush on answering all these** - just jotting them down as I build.

The more I understand, the better I can tailor the automation to YOUR actual workflow.
