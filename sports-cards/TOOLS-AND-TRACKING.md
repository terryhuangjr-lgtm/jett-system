# Tools & Tracking Systems

## Current Tools

### Card Ladder ($15/mo)
- Checks across multiple auction sites
- Provides comp data
- Current tool of choice

### eBay Sold Listings (Free)
- Filter: Completed/Sold items
- Use most recent 3-4 sales for comps
- Manual but reliable

## Condition Evaluation

### Grading Criteria (In Order)
1. **Corners** - Sharp vs rounded/damaged
2. **Centering** - Image centered on card
3. **Surface** - Clean, no scratches/marks
4. **Edges** - Clean cuts, no chipping

### Red Flags
**"Read" in title** - AVOID ALWAYS
- Means "read the description" = damaged card
- Auto-skip these

### Evaluation Process
- Analyze eBay photos carefully
- Look for all 4 criteria
- Conservative = better (no surprises from PSA)

## Current Tracking (Honest Assessment)

### What They Track Now
❌ Inventory - None
❌ PSA submissions - No clear list of what's in grading
❌ Return dates - Don't track when cards come back
❌ Sales - Don't track
❌ Profit - Don't track

**Quote:** "It's pretty bad. Like I said, it's a hobby right now but if we took this thing seriously, these are all metrics we would need to track!"

### What Needs Tracking (If Scaling)

**Inventory Database:**
- Card details (player, year, insert, serial #)
- Purchase date & price
- Source (eBay, Buyee, local, show)
- Condition notes
- Photos

**PSA Pipeline:**
- Submission date
- Submission service (value vs rush)
- Expected return date
- Actual return date
- Grade received (10, 9, etc.)
- Cost (submission fee)

**Sales Tracking:**
- List date
- Sale date & price
- Platform (eBay, show, local)
- Fees
- Net profit
- Days to sell

**Metrics Dashboard:**
- Total inventory value
- Cards in grading (count & value)
- Cards available to list
- Monthly sales
- Profit margins (overall & per card)
- ROI by player/era/type

## PSA Details

**Frequency:** Monthly (target), sometimes miss months

**Turnaround Time:** 2-5 months (highly variable)

**Service Levels:**
- **Value tier** (default) - Keep costs low
- **Rush service** - For big cards with big profit potential
  - Example: 90s/2000s MJ inserts
  - Rush fee justified by profit margin

**Decision criteria for rush:**
- Expected profit covers rush fee with room to spare
- High-value card
- Want to capitalize on market timing

## Automation Opportunities 🚀

### High Priority
1. **Inventory tracking** - Database with all cards
2. **PSA pipeline dashboard** - What's in grading, when it returns
3. **Profit tracking** - Actual P&L per card
4. **Comp checker** - Quick mobile lookup for shows/stores

### Medium Priority
5. **Purchase alerts** - Scanner finds opportunities
6. **Market trends** - Track what's hot
7. **Season timing alerts** - Pre-season load-up reminders

### Future
8. **Photo analysis** - AI grading prediction
9. **Portfolio analytics** - Best players, best eras, best types
10. **Tax reporting** - Annual sales summary

**Bottom line:** They're sophisticated buyers with no data infrastructure. HUGE opportunity to add value through automation.
