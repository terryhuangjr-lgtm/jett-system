# 21M Content Rules

## The 21M Angle
21 million Bitcoin. Fixed supply. Scarce. The hardest money ever created.

We compare:
- **Sports contracts** (fiat - unlimited printing) → converted to BTC
- **Bitcoin facts** (hard money - fixed supply) → scarcity theme

## Content Types

### Sports Content
- Real verified contracts (NBA, NFL, MLB players)
- Contract → BTC conversion using signing date price
- Angle: "That $200M contract was X BTC. Same BTC today, dollars lost value."

### Bitcoin Content

- Angle: "Only 21 million BTC will ever exist. Central banks print unlimited dollars."

- Contract amount (verified via Spotrac, team sites)
- Signing date (for BTC price lookup)
