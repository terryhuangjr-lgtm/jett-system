# eBay Scraper Project

## Goal
Automated eBay scanner that finds gems while Terry sleeps using eBay API.

**Status:** Planned for Feb 3, 2026

## What It Will Do
- Search eBay for specific criteria (Michael Jordan cards, collectibles, etc.)
- Filter by price, condition, ending soon
- Find undervalued items (comps vs current price)
- Alert on good deals
- Run overnight, results ready in morning

## Requirements
**eBay API Access:**
- Need to register for eBay Developer account
- Get API keys (App ID, Cert ID, Dev ID)
- Free tier should work for initial use

**Search Criteria to Define:**
- What to search for (MJ cards, specific sets, etc.)
- Price ranges
- Condition requirements (PSA, BGS grades)
- Auction vs Buy It Now
- Ending soon window (last 2 hours, 24 hours, etc.)

## Game-Changer Potential
**Why this matters:**
- Finds deals while you sleep
- Faster than manual searching
- Can track multiple searches simultaneously
- Historical comp data comparison
- Real arbitrage opportunity

**Use Cases:**
- Flip collectibles for profit
- Build personal collection at discount
- Spot market trends
- Find mis-priced items before others

## Technical Approach
1. **eBay Finding API** - search active listings
2. **Local database** - store results, track trends
3. **Comp comparison** - historical sale prices
4. **Alert system** - Slack notification for hot finds
5. **Runs on schedule** - overnight scans, morning report

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1. Register for eBay Developer account (if needed)
2. Get API credentials
3. Build basic scraper
4. Test with MJ card searches
5. Add comp comparison logic
6. Set up overnight automation

## Success Metrics
- Finds at least 5-10 potential deals per night
- Saves 2+ hours of manual searching
- Identifies actual arbitrage opportunities
- Pays for itself with first flip
