# Calendar - REMOVED

**Date:** Feb 2, 2026

**Decision:** Terry will manage his own calendar - Jett doesn't need access.

## What Was Removed

1. **USER.md** - Calendar section (Google Calendar access, shared account, etc.)
2. **AGENTS.md** - Calendar checks from heartbeat guidance
3. **MEMORY.md** - Calendar integration reference
4. **MORNING-BRIEF-CONFIG.md** - Deleted entirely
5. **Morning Brief Cron Job** - Updated to remove "TODAY'S SCHEDULE" section

## What Remains

Morning brief (7:30 AM weekdays) now includes:
1. Weather
2. Email updates
3. New capability suggestion

**No calendar/schedule checking.**

**Status:** Complete - all calendar references removed from documentation and automation.
