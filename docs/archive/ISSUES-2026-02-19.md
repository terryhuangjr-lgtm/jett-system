# CRITICAL ISSUES - Feb 19, 2026

**Status:** 🔴 System NOT Production Ready
**Impact:** 3 major content pipelines failing
**Since:** Feb 15 (no testing for 4 days)

---

## Issue #1: Podcast Summary - NOT A BUG (Queue Empty)

**Status:** ℹ️ Resolved - System working as designed
**Severity:** Low (workflow issue, not code issue)
**When:** Daily at 3 AM (Podcast Processing job)

### Root Cause FOUND
Podcast queue is **empty**. No podcasts added to process.

**Evidence:**
- Ran: `python3 manage_queue.py view`
- Output: "Queue is empty (5 max)"

### How It's Supposed to Work
1. User adds podcast URL: `python3 manage_queue.py add <youtube-url>`
2. Processing job runs at 3 AM, finds queue has URLs
3. Downloads, transcribes, summarizes
4. Deploy job posts summary to Slack

**Current State:**
- ✅ Processing script works (tested manually)
- ✅ Queue management system works
- ✅ Summarization works (tested manually)
- ❌ Queue is empty — nobody has added podcasts yet

### This is NOT a system failure
The podcast system is fully functional. It just needs input (podcast URLs in the queue) to produce output.

### To Test
```bash
python3 /home/clawd/skills/podcast-summary/manage_queue.py add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
# Then process runs at next 3 AM, or manual: python3 run_background.py
```

## Issue #2: eBay Scan Results - EMPTY

**Status:** 🔴 Blocking
**Severity:** High
**When:** Daily 9 AM (eBay Scan jobs - one per day) + 10 AM Deploy

### Problem
eBay scans not producing results. Wednesday (Feb 19) scan **found zero deals**.

**Evidence:**
- No result files from Feb 19 in `/home/clawd/clawd/ebay-scanner/results/`
- Last results: Feb 16
- eBay Deploy job at 10 AM ran but had nothing to post

### Possible Causes
1. eBay API changes / blocks
2. Search filters too strict (no deals match criteria)
3. Scan script not executing properly
4. Results file not being saved

### Investigation Needed
- Check `/home/clawd/clawd/ebay-scanner/logs/` for errors
- Manually run: `cd /home/clawd/clawd/ebay-scanner && node run-from-config.js wednesday`
- Verify eBay API access working

## Issue #3: Sports/Bitcoin Tweets - REPEATED (Recurring)

**Status:** 🔴 Recurring Problem
**Severity:** Critical (damages credibility)
**When:** Daily at 4 AM (BTC) and 5 AM (Sports) - then deployed 8:45 AM / 7:30 AM

### Problem
Same tweets posted multiple times over consecutive days. "Another issue we keep running into."

**Examples Mentioned:**
- (Need specifics - which tweets repeated?)

**Current State:**
- Feb 19 BTC file has 3 tweets (generated 14:54 UTC)
- Feb 19 Sports file has 3 tweets (generated 14:54 UTC)
- Unknown if these are NEW or REPEATS from Feb 18

### Root Cause Unknown
Likely sources:
1. **Generator reusing old player/facts** - not pulling fresh data
2. **Deployed content not being tracked** - posting same content again
3. **Verification system failing** - allowing duplicates past validation
4. **Memory file not resetting** - accumulating old content

### Investigation Needed
1. Compare Feb 19 tweets with Feb 18 tweets (are they identical?)
2. Check generator script for **deduplication logic**
3. Check deploy script for **history tracking**
4. Review: `21m-claude-generator.js` and `deploy-21m-tweet.js`

### Files Involved
- Generator: `/home/clawd/clawd/automation/21m-claude-generator.js`
- Deployer: `/home/clawd/clawd/automation/deploy-21m-tweet.js`
- Memory: `/home/clawd/clawd/memory/21m-*-verified-content.json`

## Issue #4: eBay Deploy Script - Hardcoded File Paths

**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Severity:** Blocks all eBay result deployments
**Found:** 2026-02-19 10:48 AM

### Problem
Deploy script is hardcoded to look for `/tmp/mj-upperdeck-scan.json` but scan produces files like `/home/clawd/clawd/ebay-scanner/results/multi_kobe_bryant_topps_chrome__topps_finest_1997_2005_r_2026-02-19.json`

**Result:** Scan works (finds 32+ deals), but deploy can't find the file and posts empty/old results

### Proof
- Scan (10:35 AM): Found 365 Kobe listings → 32 qualified deals ✅
- Deploy (10:43 AM): Looked for `/tmp/mj-upperdeck-scan.json` → FILE NOT FOUND → Posted empty results ❌

### Root Cause
File: `/home/clawd/clawd/automation/deploy-ebay-scans.js`
- Hardcoded paths to test files
- Not dynamic (doesn't check current day's results directory)
- Doesn't have fallback logic

### Solution
Rewrite deploy script to:
1. Dynamically find latest scan files in `/home/clawd/clawd/ebay-scanner/results/`
2. Or use config file pointer to "latest scan"
3. Not hardcoded test paths

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## Action Items

**For Mini (URGENT):**
1. Investigate podcast summary generation (why zero output?)
2. Check eBay scanner (why no results?)
3. FIX recurring tweet duplication issue (critical for credibility)
4. Fix sports betting database schema (blocking testing)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours to diagnose and fix all four issues

**Terry's Goal:** "Flawless week" starting Monday - system needs to be SOLID by then.
