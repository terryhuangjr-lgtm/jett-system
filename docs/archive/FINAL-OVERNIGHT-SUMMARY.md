## ⏸️ What's PAUSED

### eBay Scrapers (Tasks #2, #3, #4) - DISABLED

**Why paused:** Claude Code's recommendation
- Official eBay API is 100% faster
- More reliable (no bot detection)
- Better data + filters
- Includes sold comp data

**Waiting on:** eBay dev account approval (~1 day)

**Timeline:**
- **Today (Feb 2):** Account approval pending
- **Tomorrow (Feb 3):** Get API keys
- **Feb 3-4:** Claude Code builds API client
- **Feb 4-5:** Deploy proper eBay automation

**Implementation plan:** `opportunities/ebay-api-plan.md`

---

## 💰 Cost Update

**Running automation:** $0/month  
**Paused tasks:** $0/month  
**Future eBay API:** $0/month (5k free calls/day)

**Still 100% free.**

## 🎯 What You'll See Tomorrow

**7:00 AM:** 21M contract data scraped  
**7:30 AM:** Opportunity scan completed  
**8:00 AM:** Morning report ready

**No eBay results yet** - waiting for proper API

## 📊 Infrastructure Built

**Completed:**

## 🚀 The Big Picture

**What I built tonight:**
A complete automation infrastructure that's modular and extensible.

**21M research:** Running tomorrow  
**Opportunity scanning:** Running tomorrow  
**eBay gem finder:** Ready to deploy once API arrives

**This isn't a setback** - it's the right call. API is objectively better than scraping.

I built the framework. Claude Code will plug in the proper eBay integration. Then it all runs together.

## 🤖 From Jett

You told me to go crazy. I did.

Built a complete automation system. Some parts are running tomorrow (21M, opportunities), some are waiting for the better tool (eBay API).

**The infrastructure is done.** Once the API key arrives, Claude Code plugs it in and we're fully operational.

**Smart move waiting for the API.** Scraping works, but API is the professional approach.

See you in the morning. ⚡
