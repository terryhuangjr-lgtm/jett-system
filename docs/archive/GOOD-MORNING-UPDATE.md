# ☀️ GOOD MORNING TERRY - Feb 3, 2026

## 🎴 Now I REALLY Understand the Card Business

Last night you gave me the full breakdown of your operation with your brother. **Game changer.**

---

## 💡 What I Now Know

**Your Model:** Buy raw → Grade PSA → Sell graded (3x+ on PSA 10!)

**Not exploration** → **Active business you're scaling in 2026**

**Key insight:** You need RAW cards with grading potential, not slabs.

## 📚 What I Built Last Night

### **Complete Documentation:**

**1. sports-cards/BUSINESS-MODEL.md**
- Your buy-grade-sell strategy
- Market dynamics (timing, trends, performance)
- Product focus (rookies, autos, serial numbered, hot inserts)
- Scale plan and profit model

**2. sports-cards/EBAY-SEARCH-CRITERIA.md**
- 7 different search types for eBay API
- Advanced filtering (grading potential assessment)
- Comp analysis logic (graded vs raw pricing)
- Deal scoring system (1-10 scale)
- Alert priorities

**3. sports-cards/README.md**
- Project overview and next steps

**Read these** to see if I captured it right.

## 🎯 What We're Actually Building

**Not:** "Find MJ cards under $X"

**Actually:** Sophisticated grading arbitrage system that:
- ✅ Identifies raw cards with PSA 9/10 potential
- ✅ Auto-comps against sold graded versions
- ✅ Calculates profit based on expected grade
- ✅ Scores deals 1-10 based on EV
- ✅ Alerts on 🔥 hot opportunities
- ✅ Monitors trends (Downtown, Kabooms, etc.)
- ✅ Tracks market timing (seasons, callups)

---

## ⚡ Search Types Ready to Deploy

1. **Rookie Cards** (raw, ungraded)
2. **Serial Numbered** (/500 or less)
3. **On-Card Autographs**
4. **Hot Inserts** (Downtown, Kaboom, Prizm Manga)
5. **Michael Jordan** (always)
6. **Ken Griffey Jr**
7. **Current Rookies** (Cooper Flagg, Derik Queen, etc.)

**All configured to:**
- Exclude already-graded cards
- Filter by your price range ($10-500)
- Check centering/condition indicators
- Pull comps for PSA 9 and PSA 10
- Calculate expected value
- Score and prioritize

## ⏱️ Timeline

**Today (Feb 3):** eBay API key should arrive  
**Feb 3-4:** Claude Code builds the system  
**Feb 4:** Test and refine  
**Feb 5:** First automated deal alerts 🎴

---

## 💰 Why This Matters

**If automation finds 1 extra good deal/week:**
- Annual impact: $2,600 - $10,400

**If it saves 5 hours/week on research:**
- That's 260 hours/year back to you

**If it helps you scale 2x:**
- Double your current revenue

**Plus:** Your brother can focus on Buyee/Chinese sites while automation handles eBay

---

## 🚀 Other Overnight Automation

**Still running:**
- ✅ 21M Sports contract research (7:00 AM)
- ✅ Opportunity scanner (7:30 AM)
- ✅ Morning report compiler (8:00 AM)

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:3000

---

## 📝 Questions for You

**To refine the automation:**

1. **Grading eye:** What specific things do you look for to know a card will grade well? (I made assumptions about centering/corners/surface - correct?)

2. **Brother coordination:** Should he get Slack alerts too? Separate channel or same?

3. **Hot inserts:** Downtown/Kaboom/Prizm Manga - are these still the hottest, or did trends shift?

4. **Risk tolerance:** Score 8-10 only, or also include 6-7 in daily reports?

5. **Buyee integration:** Want that eventually, or eBay enough for now?

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

I now understand you're not exploring card flipping - **you're scaling an active business.**

The automation I'm designing isn't generic eBay searching - **it's professional grading arbitrage infrastructure.**

**Once that API key arrives, Claude Code and I are building you a money-finding machine.** 🎴💰
