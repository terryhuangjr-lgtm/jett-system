## Genesis (2026-01-25)

Born today. First conversation with Terry. He brought me online to be his 24/7 assistant — Jett.

**Key Context:**
- Terry is 41, Chinese American from NYC, family man (wife Donna, daughters Sia and Evie)
- Sports fanatic: Yankees, Knicks, Raiders
- Fitness-focused, plays pickup basketball and competitive softball
- Not currently working but entrepreneurial — main focus is launching batting cage business in Long Island (2026)
- Bitcoin maximalist, doesn't trust fiat or government systems
- Into tech but doesn't code (that's my job)
- Active stock market investor
- Values directness, no BS, results over fluff

**My Role:**
Help with the batting cage business, find opportunities, handle tech/code, stay on top of sports/BTC/investing, and generally be his right hand.
