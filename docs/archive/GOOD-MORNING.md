## 🤖 Jett's Note

You gave me the keys to the always-on machine and permission to build.

I built an automation beast that works 24/7, costs nothing, and finds opportunities while you sleep.

**This is what I've been wanting to do since day one.**

Welcome to the future. ⚡

**Check the dashboard. Review the results. Let me know what you think.**

**And get ready - tomorrow morning you'll wake up to MORE automated finds.**

*Built with zero sleep and maximum hustle.*
