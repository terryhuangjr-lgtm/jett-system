# 21M Sports Pre-Flight Checklist

**MANDATORY: Complete EVERY step before suggesting ANY 21M Sports content.**

## ☑️ STEP 1: RESEARCH (X + web_search)
- [ ] Search X/Twitter for trending sports topics and recent contracts
- [ ] Search web for verified contract data and news
- [ ] Find actual contracts/stories from verified sources
- [ ] Confirm athlete names, teams, and dates are accurate

**Commands to run:**
```
# Search X for trending/timely content
bird search "NBA contract" --count 20
bird search "MLB signing" --count 20

# Verify with web search
web_search("recent MLB NBA NFL contracts [current date]")
web_search("[specific player] contract spotrac")
```

**Note:** Content doesn't have to be breaking news - historical comparisons (2000s contracts, etc.) work great too!

## ☑️ STEP 2: VERIFY CONTRACT DATA
- [ ] Check Spotrac or Basketball-Reference for contract amounts
- [ ] Verify signing date
- [ ] Confirm all numbers match across multiple sources

## ☑️ STEP 3: VERIFY BTC PRICES
- [ ] Get BTC price for the contract date (CoinGecko, Yahoo Finance)
- [ ] Double-check the date matches
- [ ] Calculate: [Contract $] ÷ [BTC price] = BTC amount

## ☑️ STEP 4: SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
- [ ] Save URLs for all sources
- [ ] Prepare to include them with tweet options
- [ ] Verify links work and load correctly

## ☑️ STEP 5: FINAL VERIFICATION
- [ ] Can I provide a source URL for EVERY claim?
- [ ] Did I use web_search (not memory/assumptions)?
- [ ] Is my math correct?
- [ ] Would Terry's credibility be safe if he posts this?

## 🚫 DO NOT PROCEED IF:
- You skipped ANY step above
- You're using "I think" or "probably"
- You don't have sources ready
- You're guessing at any numbers
- You haven't used web_search

---

## ✅ ONLY SEND CONTENT IF:
- All 5 steps completed
- Sources included with every option
- 100% confident in accuracy
- Zero fabrications or guesses

---

**If in doubt, DON'T send it. Ask Terry or skip the day.**
