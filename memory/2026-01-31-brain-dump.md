# Terry's Brain Dump - 2026-01-31

## What I Learned

### Financial Reality
- **Runway:** Several years but doesn't want to wait
- **Monthly need:** $4K total ($2K from rental, needs $2.5K from work)
- **Assets:** 13 BTC, $300K IRA, $100K brokerage, $30K cash
- **Key insight:** He needs $2.5K/month to be comfortable. Anything beyond = luxury.

### Batting Cage Details
**Location:** Nassau County North Shore
- New Hyde Park, Roslyn, Manhasset, Great Neck, Lynbrook, Valley Stream

**Funding:** Self-funded $100-150K (may seek investors depending on opportunity)

**Timeline:** Q2 2026 to start searching

**Partners:** Solo, or possibly brothers/ex-boss Pat

**Blockers:**
1. **"Is this the right move?"** ← The real question
2. Family timing - waiting for right moment
3. Business model - boutique vs large?

### Family Context
- **Donna:** Full support, lets Terry handle financials
- **Buy-in needed:** Kid decisions, taking from savings
- **She doesn't know:** How much BTC he has or what it's worth

### What Drains His Time
- Taking care of kids / entertaining them (daily)

### What He's Avoiding
- Starting the batting cage (because unsure if it's right)

### What's Tedious
- Real estate searching (I can automate this!)

### Decision Style
- Full breakdown (not quick takes)
- Tell him my recommendation
- Deep analysis, thorough research
- Moderate to aggressive risk (lean aggressive)

## Key Insights

**The Real Question:** Not "how do I start a batting cage?" but "should I?"

**The Dilemma:** 
- Has several years of runway
- Doesn't want to burn it waiting
- Wants to build something but unsure if batting cage is it
- Procrastinating because uncertainty

**What He Actually Needs:**
1. Help deciding IF batting cage is the move
2. If yes → full execution plan
3. If no → what else?
4. Either way → cash-flowing fiat options while he figures it out

## Action Items for Jett

1. **Automate real estate search** - Set up alerts for commercial properties in target areas
2. **Decision framework** - Help him think through the batting cage decision systematically
3. **Cash flow options** - Research $2.5K/month fiat income opportunities
4. **Take pressure off** - He doesn't need to decide right now. He has runway.
