## Claude Desktop Installation
- Terry installed Claude Desktop (Claude Code)
- Created comprehensive file upload system with helpers and documentation
- Built optimization library for token efficiency
- New tools in `/home/clawd/clawd/lib/`:
  - `file-upload-helper.js` - Path resolution, file validation
  - `gmail-helper.js` - Gmail automation workflows
  - `state-manager.js`, `batch-ops.js`, `token-optimizer.js` - Efficiency tools

## Communication Preferences Updated (PERMANENT)
**Main channel: Slack**
- Morning briefs → Slack DM (user: Terry)
- 21M Sports reminders (9am, 12pm, 7pm) → #21-m-sports channel
- General correspondence → Slack DM
- Telegram remains as backup channel

Updated USER.md to reflect Slack as primary communication channel.

## 21M Sports
- Content bank analyzed and documented
- Daily post reminders now go to #21-m-sports Slack channel
- Theme for today (Friday): Fiat Debasement Friday
  - Compare mediocre current contracts to legendary past contracts
  - Show how inflation makes bench players richer than 90s superstars

## Token Tracking Request
- Terry wants API usage tracking to monitor costs
- Plan to build dashboard showing daily/weekly spend
- Will track both Clawdbot and Claude Desktop usage
- Budget alerts when hitting thresholds

## API Usage Dashboard - Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Built the data layer for tracking API costs:**

**What's working:**
- Parser script extracts all Clawdbot session data (tokens, costs, timestamps)
- Historical data: 1,478 API calls totaling $88.61
- Data organized by agent, model, project, and cost breakdown
- Output: `dashboard/data/token-usage.json`

**Structure created:**
```
dashboard/
├── README.md              (overview)
├── HANDOFF.md            (detailed instructions for Claude Code)
├── config.json           (budget thresholds: $5/day, $30/week, $120/month)
├── data/
│   └── token-usage.json  (parsed data - ready to visualize)
├── scripts/
│   ├── parse-clawdbot.js (extracts Clawdbot usage)
│   └── update-data.sh    (quick refresh script)
└── public/               (empty - waiting for Claude Code)
```

**Next: Claude Code Phase**
Terry will bring in Claude Code to build:
- Dashboard UI with charts (daily spend, project breakdown, agent breakdown)
- Budget alert system (Slack notifications at 80%, 90%, 100% thresholds)
- Weekly summary generator
- Filters (date range, agent, project)

**Handoff ready:** `dashboard/HANDOFF.md` has complete instructions for Claude Code

## Slack Channels Directory System ✅
**Created organized file structure for Slack channel notes:**

```
slack-channels/
├── README.md          (explains the system)
├── dm-terry/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md     (channel-specific context for efficiency)
│   └── notes.md
├── 21-m-sports/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md     (purpose, style, themes, audience)
│   ├── content-bank.md
│   └── schedule.md
├── batting-cage/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md     (business context, market focus)
│   └── notes.md
├── investing/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md     (BTC maximalism, anti-Fed, stock research)
│   └── notes.md
└── general/
    ├── CONTEXT.md     (catch-all guidance)
    └── notes.md
```

**CONTEXT.md Files:**
- Auto-loaded when working in each channel
- Contains: purpose, tone, key people, quick links, efficiency notes
- Eliminates token waste on "what is this channel about?" every time
- Channel-specific guidelines for maximum efficiency

**Workflow:**
- "Save it" / "Save file" = persist to appropriate channel .md file
- "Remember" = mental note only (doesn't persist)
- Each channel has its own organized .md files (notes, content-bank, schedule, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Instantly searchable with grep
- No compute overhead (vs PDFs)
- Context-organized by channel
- Auto-loaded channel context = massive efficiency gain
- Easy to reference and build upon

## Next Steps
- Hand off to Claude Code for dashboard UI
- Build 21M Sports content generators with Claude Desktop
- Test Gmail API setup for reliable file attachments
- Batting cage business tools
