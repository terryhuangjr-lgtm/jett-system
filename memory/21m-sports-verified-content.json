    "De'Aaron Fox just signed a $163M deal with the Spurs. That's 2,397 Bitcoin. When he signed it on May 30, BTC was worth roughly the same as today ($68k). His contract is literally one-upping crypto's most famous asset in terms of pure hodl value. 💰🏀",
    "$163 MILLION to play basketball vs HODLing 2,400 Bitcoin. De'Aaron Fox's Spurs contract could've been a crypto investment for the risk-averse athlete. Instead, he chose something even more volatile: the San Antonio Spurs' playoff chances. 😂",
    "The math is wild: De'Aaron Fox's $163M contract = 2,397 BTC. Bitcoin hasn't moved much since he signed, but his contract has a 4-year guarantee. In crypto terms, that's basically a stablecoin. Maybe athletes are smarter than we thought? 🤔"
