    "Peyton Manning signed a $96M contract with Denver in 2012. If he'd taken it all in Bitcoin instead? 9.6M BTC.\n\nWorth $648 BILLION today.\n\nThe king of quarterbacks met the king of crypto at the worst possible time. 💀",
    "The math hits different:\n• Peyton Manning: $96M (2012)\n• Same value in Bitcoin then: 9.6M BTC\n• Same Bitcoin today: $648B\n\nSometimes getting paid in the \"safe\" option is the real gamble.",
    "2012 Peyton: \"I'll take the $96M guaranteed contract\"\n2012 Bitcoin: \"cool story bro\"\n2025 Bitcoin: 💰💰💰💰💰\n\nThat 9.6M BTC would've been a better dynasty than any Broncos Super Bowl run. 📉➡️🚀"
