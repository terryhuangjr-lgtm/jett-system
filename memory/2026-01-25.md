# 2026-01-25 - Calendar Setup & Morning Brief

## Calendar Integration - WORKING ✅
- **Solution:** Terry logged into Google Calendar app on his phone as jett.theassistant@gmail.com
- **Result:** We now share the same calendar account - Terry can add events via app, I can manage via browser/API
- **Test successful:** Created "Kilians Super Bowl party" event for Sunday Feb 8, 5-9pm
- **No OAuth complexity needed** - simple shared login approach works perfectly
