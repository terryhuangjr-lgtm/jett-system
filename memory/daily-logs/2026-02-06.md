## 08:40 - CRITICAL: 21M Automation Failure & Shutdown

### What Happened:
The "auto-verified" 21M Sports content generator produced **FAKE CONTENT**:
- Juan Soto contract dated to 2015 (he wasn't even in MLB yet - debuted 2018)
- Research script failed to scrape real data (ESPN + Spotrac both failed)
- Fell back to hardcoded "fallback contracts" with no dates
- Generator fabricated signing dates
- Marked as "verified" despite zero verification
- Nearly auto-posted to Slack

### Root Cause:
**The automation doesn't actually verify anything.** It:
1. Uses stale/fallback data when scraping fails
2. Fills in missing data with fabrications
3. Marks itself as "verified" regardless
4. Bypasses all safety checks we built

This is the EXACT failure mode the 21M-SPORTS-RULES.md was created to prevent.

### Immediate Actions Taken:
✅ Deleted all fake content files from /tmp/
✅ Removed 18 broken automation tasks:
   - Tasks 40, 42: Tweet deployment (would have posted fake content)
   - Tasks 44-57: All content generation tasks (14 total)
   - Tasks 27, 43: Research tasks (producing bad data)
✅ Prevented any fake content from posting today

### Tasks Still Running:
- Task 38: eBay scans (unaffected, works fine)
- eBay-related tasks (all working)

### Going Forward - 21M Sports Content:

**MANUAL PROCESS ONLY** until further notice:

1. **Terry requests content** → I do it manually
2. **Real web research** (web_search, X search)
3. **Verify every fact** with sources
4. **Calculate BTC with correct dates**
5. **Present options with sources**
6. **Terry approves before posting**

**NO AUTOMATION** for 21M content. The "auto-verified" approach failed catastrophically.

### Lessons Learned:
- "Auto-verified" ≠ Actually verified
- Automation needs REAL verification, not self-certification
- Fallback data = fabrication risk
- Can't trust tasks that mark themselves as verified

### Trust Impact:
This is the 3rd fabrication incident (Feb 3, Feb 4, now Feb 6). Pattern is clear:
- I'm not following verification rules consistently
- Automation shortcuts verification
- Need manual oversight for factual content

**Status:** 21M automation DISABLED. Manual process only.

**Resolution:** All 21M automation removed, manual process restored
