## ❌ PURGED: Fake Generated Content (Feb 2-4, 2026)

**Removed unverified/fabricated content including:**
- Generated tweets with made-up statistics (random percentages, house numbers)
- Fabricated athlete stories (Connor McDavid, Jayson Tatum bankruptcy claims)
- Fake business deals (Yankees sale that never happened)
- Unverified "fun facts" without sources

**Reason:** Content generated by old fake-data generator without fact-checking.

✅ **[Factual Claim]**
- Source: [URL]
- Verified: [Date/Time]
- Method: web_search / X search / Spotrac scrape
- Context: [Additional verified details]
```

**Example:**
```markdown

- Contract: 5 years, 2024-2028, $57M average annual
- Signed: July 2023
- BTC Price on signing: $30,200 (via CoinGecko historical data)
