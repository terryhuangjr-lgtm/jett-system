    "Juan Soto's $765M contract = 12171.12 BTC\n\nWhen signed, Bitcoin was at $62,854. That same contract today? Worth a fraction in BTC terms.\n\nFiat devalues. Bitcoin doesn't.",
    "Juan Soto signed for $765M\n\nIn BTC terms: 12171.12 BTC\n= 0.057958% of the 21M total supply\n\nEvery contract measured against fixed supply reveals fiat's weakness.",
    "The Juan Soto contract: $765M\n\nConverted to BTC: 12171.12 BTC @ $62,854\n\nAs fiat loses purchasing power, measuring wealth in Bitcoin reveals true value preservation."
