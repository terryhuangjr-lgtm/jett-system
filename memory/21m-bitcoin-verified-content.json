    "10,000 Bitcoin bought 2 pizzas in 2010. Those pizzas would cost $689M today. That's not about pizza. That's what happens when you bet on scarcity and get it right.",
    "You don't need a million to win. $50/month starting in 2015 is worth $1.2M now. Bitcoin doesn't care how small you start. Time compounds everything."
