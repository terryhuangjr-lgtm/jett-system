    "Your savings erode by design. Inflation has destroyed 97% of the dollar's value since 1913. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million forever. One preserves wealth. One doesn't.",
    "Laszlo bought two pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoin in 2010 for $41. That transaction is now worth $688 million. Not volatility. Appreciation. And it's still accelerating.",
    "You signed a million-dollar contract. Inflation will steal 20% of it over five years. Or you put 10% in Bitcoin, forget about it, and that 10% becomes 90% of your net worth."
