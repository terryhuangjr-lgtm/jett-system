## Podcast Summarization Channel Created

Terry created #podcastsummary channel in Slack and introduced the podcast summarization workflow.

**Reference doc:** `/home/clawd/clawd/memory/PODCAST_SUMMARIZATION_JETT_REFERENCE.md`

**Key capabilities:**
- Immediate transcription: "summarize this podcast: [URL]"
- Queue system: "add [URL] to podcast queue" (processes at 3 AM)
- Queue management: view, remove, clear
- Dashboard at http://localhost:5001

**Tech stack:**
- Whisper (local speech-to-text)
- Ollama (summarization)
- SQLite (queue/history)
- Auto-posts to #podcastsummary when done

**Files:**
- Main script: `/home/clawd/skills/podcast-summary/summarize_podcast.py`
- Queue manager: `/home/clawd/skills/podcast-summary/manage_queue.py`
- Dashboard: `/home/clawd/skills/podcast-summary/app.py`
- Output: `/home/clawd/data/podcasts/summaries/`

## Podcast Processing Migrated to Task Manager

Moved from standalone cron to centralized task manager (port 3000).

**New scheduled tasks:**
- **3:00 AM** - Podcast Processing (runs `process_queue.py`, auto-posts to Slack)
- **6:30 AM** - Podcast Summary Deployment (placeholder for now)

**Benefits:**
- Visible in task manager UI
- Consistent with other automation
- Unified logging and monitoring
- Easy enable/disable control

**6:30 AM task options:**
- Check for new summaries and send reminder
- Daily recap of processed podcasts
- Queue status report
- Leave empty if 3 AM post is sufficient
