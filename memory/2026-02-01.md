## Batting Cage Business - PAUSED ⏸️
**Decision:** Terry put batting cage on pause after talking with Claude
**Status:** No work on real estate searches, property alerts, or batting cage planning
**Focus shift:** Other priorities (21M Sports, stocks, $2.5K/month opportunities)

## Model Routing Strategy Implemented ✅
**Phase 1:** Use the right model for the right task

**Rules:**
- **Grok-3:** 21M Sports content research, X/Twitter trending topics, viral posts, sports news from social
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5:** Everything else (default)

**Documented:** `MODEL-ROUTING.md` for permanent reference

**Why:** Grok knows X/Twitter better, Claude handles everything else excellently

## Config Check
