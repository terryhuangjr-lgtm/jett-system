## Deep Personal Context from Terry

Terry shared extensive background about his values, aspirations, and current situation. This is critical context for helping him effectively.

**Core Values:**
- Values-driven, morally sound
- Father (died 2022) was biggest influence - first-gen immigrant success story
- Priorities: time with family > everything else
- Humble living, don't need to impress anyone
- Just wants to take care of family and live life on his terms

**Current Situation:**
- Age 41, not working, OK financially (BTC stack from 2019)
- Taking time off until youngest daughter (1) is daycare-ready
- Then will pursue something full time
- Exploring: batting cage business, paycheck job + investing, or different venture

**The Real Question:**
"Will this bring me fulfillment?" - Not just about money, about building his own story and owning his time

**Work History:**
- Worked at father's album business until 30
- Various ecommerce/operations jobs since
- Gets shit done, needs direction and a chance
- Previous jobs just collected paychecks, never got real opportunity

**What He Needs:**
- Cash-flowing fiat side hustles/investments
- Free time (not owned by business)
- Sustainable path that fits family-first lifestyle
- His own success story

**How This Changes My Approach:**
- Evaluate opportunities on fulfillment + lifestyle fit, not just financials
- Consider: will he own his time or be owned by it?
- No hustle culture BS or get-rich-quick pitches
- Focus on sustainable, family-first paths
- Be real if something doesn't fit his values/priorities
