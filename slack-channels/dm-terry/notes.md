### Deep Context Brain Dump
Terry shared deep personal context about values, aspirations, and current situation.

**Key takeaways:**
- Father (died 2022) was biggest influence - first-gen immigrant, self-built, morally sound
- Regrets not applying himself in school, coasted thinking he'd work for dad
- Now wants his own story, but questioning what will bring real fulfillment
- BTC stack from 2019 is life-changing, needs cash flow in meantime
- Taking time off until youngest (1) is daycare-ready, then full throttle
- Priorities: time > everything, family first, humble living, travel
- Real question: "Will batting cage (or any business) actually fulfill me?"

**How this changes my approach:**
- Evaluate opportunities on fulfillment + lifestyle fit, not just money
- Consider: will he own his time or be owned by it?
- No hustle culture BS or "get rich quick" pitches
- Focus on sustainable, family-first paths
- Be real if something doesn't fit

**Saved to:** USER.md (full update with all context)

### Batting Cage - ON PAUSE
- No work on batting cage until further notice
- No real estate searches or property monitoring
- Terry exploring other opportunities

### Tool Routing Strategy - Phase 1 Live
**Grok for X/social, Claude for everything else**
- X/Twitter searches → Grok-3 subagents (automatic)
- 21M Sports research → Grok-3 (free, better social intel)
- Everything else → Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default)
- **Why:** Token efficiency + better results for social media tasks
- **Saved to:** USER.md

### Config Updates
- Memory flush enabled
- Session memory search enabled
- Gateway restarted successfully
