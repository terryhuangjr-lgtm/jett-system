## About 21M Sports

Bitcoin-meets-sports content account showing how fiat debasement affects sports contracts.

**Core Concept:**
- Modern bench players earn more than 90s legends
- Not because they're better - because dollars are worth less
- Sports economics through a Bitcoin/hard money lens

- Monday: Manic Monday (breaking news, hot takes)

- Thursday: Thoughtful Thursday (deep analysis, economics)
- Friday: Fiat Debasement Friday (THE signature content)
- Saturday: Storyline Saturday (narratives, drama)
- Sunday: Stats Sunday (numbers, data visualization)
