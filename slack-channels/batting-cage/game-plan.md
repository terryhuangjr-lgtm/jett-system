# Batting Cage - Path 2 Game Plan
**Strategy:** Explore while deciding (no commitment, gather data)
**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Phase 1: Automate Real Estate Search (Week 1)

### What Jett Does:
- [ ] Set up alerts for commercial properties
- [ ] Target areas: New Hyde Park, Roslyn, Manhasset, Great Neck, Lynbrook, Valley Stream
- [ ] Filter criteria:
  - Size: 4500-5000 sq ft (sweet spot)
  - Price: $20-$24/sq ft/year ($7.5K-$10K/month rent)
  - Zoning: Commercial/mixed use
- [ ] Daily digest delivered to Slack every morning
- [ ] Include: address, price, size, zoning, link

### What Terry Does:
- [ ] Provide price range
- [ ] Provide minimum sq ft needed
- [ ] Review daily digests (2 min/day)
- [ ] Flag anything interesting

## Phase 2: Market Research (Week 1-2)

### What Jett Does:
- [ ] Competitor analysis (existing batting cages in Nassau County)
  - Locations
  - Pricing models
  - Services offered
  - Reviews/complaints
  - What's missing?
- [ ] Demand analysis
  - Youth sports participation rates in target towns
  - High school baseball programs
  - Travel team presence
  - Adult recreational leagues
- [ ] Financial modeling
  - Boutique model (3-4 cages, premium pricing)
  - Large model (8-12 cages, volume pricing)
  - Revenue projections
  - Break-even analysis
  - Time to profitability

### What Terry Does:
- [ ] Review findings
- [ ] Gut-check the numbers
- [ ] React to what he sees

## Phase 3: Decision Framework (Week 2-3)

### What Jett Builds:
- [ ] Scoring system based on Terry's priorities:
  - Time freedom (weight: high)
  - Cash flow potential (weight: high)
  - Scalability (weight: medium)
  - Family fit (weight: high)
  - Actual interest (weight: medium)
- [ ] Compare batting cage vs other opportunities
- [ ] Clear recommendation with reasoning

### What Terry Does:
- [ ] Fill in "actual interest" score (only he knows this)
- [ ] Adjust weights if needed
- [ ] Make the call: go/no-go/keep exploring

## Phase 4: Alternative Research (Parallel)

### What Jett Does:
- [ ] Research $2.5K/month fiat opportunities:
  - Consulting/contracting (sports industry?)
  - Service businesses (low overhead)
  - Scalable side hustles
  - Franchise opportunities (low time investment)
- [ ] Filter by: time freedom, cash flow, family fit
- [ ] Present top 3-5 options

### What Terry Does:
- [ ] Review options
- [ ] Compare to batting cage
- [ ] See what resonates

## Success Metrics

**Good outcome = One of these:**
1. "Yes, batting cage - here's the plan" (confidence level 80%+)
2. "No, batting cage - doing X instead" (confidence level 80%+)
3. "Need more data - here's what I need to see" (clear next steps)

**Bad outcome:**
- Still stuck at 60/40 in 4 weeks
- No new information gathered
- Decision paralysis continues

## Timeline

- **Week 1:** Real estate alerts live, market research starts
- **Week 2:** Market research complete, decision framework built
- **Week 3:** Alternative research complete, Terry makes the call
- **Week 4:** Execute on decision (or extend exploration with clear goals)

## What Terry Needs to Provide

**Now:**
- ✅ Size: 4500-5000 sq ft
- ✅ Price: $20-$24/sq ft/year ($7.5K-$10K/month)

**Later (when reviewing data):**
- Gut reactions to market findings
- Interest level score (1-10)
- Any deal-breakers discovered

## What This Costs

**Time:**
- Terry: 5-10 min/day reviewing digests
- Terry: 1-2 hours/week reviewing research
- Jett: Automated (no ongoing ask)

**Money:**
- $0 (just research)

**Commitment:**
- Zero (just gathering data)

**Next step:** Get price range + sq ft from Terry, then I start building.
