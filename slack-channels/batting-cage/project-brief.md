# Batting Cage Project Brief

## Current Status: Planning Phase

**Target Timeline:** Q2 2026 to seriously start (property search, website, equipment purchase)

## Location Target

**Primary Areas (Nassau County):**
- North Shore: New Hyde Park, Roslyn, Manhasset, Great Neck
- Western Nassau: Lynbrook, Valley Stream

## Financials

**Self-Funded Budget:** $100-150K initial investment
- Betting on himself
- Open to investors depending on size/scope
- Partner options: brothers or ex-boss Pat (trusted, has business experience)

**Monthly Requirements:**
- Personal burn rate: $4K/month
- Already covered: $2K rental income
- Minimum needed from business: $2.5K/month (anything beyond = luxury)

**Capital Available:**
- 13 BTC (NOT touching - hold forever)
- $300K in IRA
- $100K in brokerage
- $30K cash
- Several year runway (but doesn't want to wait that long)

**Risk Tolerance:** Moderate to aggressive (lean aggressive)

## Current Blockers

1. **Is this the right move?** - Main decision point
2. **What kind of facility?**
   - Boutique vs large scale?
   - What services/format?
   - What makes it viable?
3. **Family timing** - waiting for youngest to be daycare-ready
4. **Real estate search** - time-consuming, could be automated/delegated

## Goals

**Primary:** Cash flow positive + time freedom + max family time

**Secondary:** 
- Easy to run and scale
- Possibly sell later or hold long-term (TBD based on experience)
- Not about getting rich - about owning his time

## Decision-Making Style

- Wants full breakdown with details (not quick takes)
- Wants recommendations, not just options ("tell me what you'd do")
- Values analysis depth
- Will make final call after thorough analysis

## Partner Considerations

**Solo by default**, but open to:
- Brothers (family, trust factor)
- Ex-boss Pat (good guy, trusted, has business ownership experience)

## Next Steps (To Be Determined)

1. Market research: Nassau County batting cage landscape
2. Real estate search automation/strategy
3. Business model decision: boutique vs scale
4. Competitive analysis
5. Customer validation
6. Equipment research
7. Pro forma financials
