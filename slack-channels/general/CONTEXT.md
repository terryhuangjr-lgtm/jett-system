## About This Channel

Use for:
- One-off research requests
- Testing/experiments
- Random ideas or questions
- Topics that don't have a dedicated channel yet
- System administration and tool setup

## Style

**Keep it flexible:**
- Match tone to the specific request
- No strict format requirements
- Save important stuff to `notes.md` if it might be referenced later
- If a topic becomes recurring, suggest creating a dedicated channel

## Quick Links
- `notes.md` - Miscellaneous saved items
- Other channels: `dm-terry/`, `21-m-sports/`, `batting-cage/`, `investing/`

## Efficiency Notes
- Don't overthink it - this is the "everything else" bucket
- If content fits better in another channel, mention it
- Keep general lightweight unless depth is specifically needed
